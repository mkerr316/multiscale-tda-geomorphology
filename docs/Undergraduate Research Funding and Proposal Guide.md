# **A Strategic Guide to Undergraduate Research: From Funding Your First Project to Fortifying Your Graduate School Application**

## **Section 1: The Landscape of Undergraduate Research Opportunities**

Embarking on a research career as an undergraduate is a formidable yet immensely rewarding endeavor. The path from a nascent idea to a published paper or a conference presentation is paved with opportunities for intellectual growth, mentorship, and professional development. For the ambitious student aiming for top-tier graduate programs, securing funding, presenting at conferences, and publishing research are not merely resume-building exercises; they are the essential credentials that demonstrate a serious commitment to a scholarly career. This guide provides a comprehensive strategic framework for navigating the landscape of undergraduate research, with a focus on opportunities available at the University of Georgia (UGA) and on the national stage. It is designed to transform an independent project into a well-supported, high-impact research program that will significantly strengthen a graduate school application.

### **1.1. The Research Lifecycle: Funding at Every Stage**

The ecosystem of academic funding is not a monolithic entity but a structured pathway designed to support research at various stages of maturity. Understanding this "research lifecycle" is the first step toward strategic planning. Opportunities can be categorized into three distinct phases, each serving a different purpose and requiring a different level of project development. Successfully navigating this progression allows a student to build momentum, using achievements in one phase to build a more compelling case for support in the next.  
Phase 1: Exploratory and Seed Funding  
This initial phase is for projects in their early stages. The funding is typically smaller and designed to provide the resources and validation needed to get a promising idea off the ground. At this stage, a fully-formed research plan with preliminary results is not always necessary; rather, the emphasis is on the potential of the idea, the student's academic preparation, and the commitment of a faculty mentor. The primary goal of securing seed funding is not just the financial support itself, but the formal recognition of the project's merit. This initial award serves as a crucial first line on a curriculum vitae (CV), demonstrating initiative and the ability to secure competitive funding. The CURO Research Award at UGA is a quintessential example of this type of support.1  
Phase 2: Intensive Research Support  
Once a research project has a clear direction and a foundational plan, the next step is to secure more substantial support that allows for a period of deep, focused work. These opportunities, often structured as summer fellowships, provide a significant stipend that enables a student to dedicate themselves to research full-time, free from the distractions of other employment or coursework. These programs are more competitive and require a well-developed research proposal. They often include structured professional development, cohort-based activities, and formal presentation requirements. Successfully completing an intensive research program signals a high level of dedication and the ability to execute a complex project over an extended period. Key examples include the CURO Summer Research Fellowship and the nationally prestigious National Science Foundation (NSF) Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Program.2  
Phase 3: Dissemination Funding  
The final phase of the research lifecycle involves sharing the project's results with the broader academic community. Research that is not communicated is incomplete. Funding in this category is specifically targeted at covering the costs associated with presenting at academic conferences, such as registration fees, travel, and lodging. Securing a dissemination grant is a capstone achievement, validating the quality of the completed work and facilitating the student's entry into the national conversation in their field. Presenting at a conference is a critical experience that hones communication skills and provides invaluable networking opportunities with faculty and graduate students from other institutions. The CURO Conference Participation Grant and travel grants from professional societies like the American Mathematical Society (AMS) are prime examples of this support.1  
Strategically sequencing these opportunities is paramount. A student who first wins a CURO Research Award gains credibility and a tangible project to discuss, making their application for a CURO Summer Fellowship or an NSF REU significantly more compelling. The results generated during that intensive summer experience then form the basis of an abstract for a national conference, which can be funded by a dissemination grant. This deliberate, phased approach builds a powerful narrative of escalating achievement and research maturity.

### **1.2. Institutional Support: Mastering the CURO Ecosystem at UGA**

For a University of Georgia undergraduate, the most vital and accessible resource is the Center for Undergraduate Research Opportunities (CURO).1 Housed within the Morehead Honors College but open to all UGA undergraduates regardless of major, GPA, or year, CURO provides a fully integrated developmental pipeline designed to guide students from their first research idea to a national conference presentation.1 Engaging with this ecosystem deliberately and sequentially should be a cornerstone of any undergraduate research strategy at UGA.  
CURO Research Award  
The CURO Research Award is the ideal entry point into funded research. It is a one-semester scholarship of $1,000 awarded to hundreds of students each year to support active, faculty-mentored research projects.1

* **Purpose and Logistics:** The award is designed to provide seed funding and formal recognition for a project. Deadlines are cyclical: July 15 for the fall semester, November 1 for the spring, and April 15 for the summer.6 The award is disbursed as a scholarship into the student's account and can be applied to any outstanding balance, with the remainder refunded.10 A student must be registered for a course in the semester they receive the award, but this does not have to be a research credit course.6  
* **Strategic Value:** This award is highly strategic. All recipients are expected to present their research at the annual spring CURO Symposium.6 Furthermore, when evaluating applications for subsequent awards, CURO gives priority consideration to students who have previously participated in the symposium.10 This creates a clear, incentivized pathway: secure the award, present the work, and thereby enhance the competitiveness of future applications for more substantial funding.

CURO Summer Research Fellowship  
This fellowship represents a significant step up in prestige, commitment, and financial support. It is a competitive, merit-based program that provides a $3,000 stipend for an intensive, immersive research experience over the summer.2

* **Requirements and Commitment:** The fellowship demands a substantial time investment, requiring a minimum of 320 hours of research between May 1 and July 31\.2 Fellows are also required to participate in a series of in-person professional development workshops and must present their findings at two separate venues: the CURO Summer Fellowship Final Forum in late July and the subsequent spring CURO Symposium.2  
* **Eligibility and Application:** Any UGA undergraduate who will be enrolled through the following spring semester is eligible to apply.2 The application, typically due March 15, requires two key student-written components: a 500-word research proposal and a 500-word personal statement detailing academic and career goals.2 A strong letter of support from the faculty mentor is also a critical component.2  
* **Selection Criteria:** The selection committee evaluates the quality and clarity of the research proposal, the student's academic record and commitment to research, and the mentor's confidence in the student and the project.2

CURO Conference Participation Grant  
This grant facilitates the final, crucial step of research dissemination. It provides up to $1,500 per semester to support students presenting their faculty-mentored research at academic conferences across the United States.1

* **Covered Expenses:** The grant can be used for conference registration, poster printing, transportation, lodging (excluding Airbnb or similar rentals), and food (receipts with alcoholic beverages are not reimbursed).10  
* **Strategic Value:** This grant transforms a local UGA project into a contribution to the national scholarly conversation. Presenting at a disciplinary conference is a hallmark of a serious researcher and is viewed very favorably by graduate admissions committees.

CURO Symposium  
The annual CURO Symposium, held each spring at the Classic Center, is UGA's premier showcase for undergraduate research.1 It offers students the opportunity to present their work to the broader community through either a 10-minute oral presentation or a poster presentation.14

* **Participation and Deadlines:** All undergraduates with a faculty mentor are eligible and encouraged to apply, regardless of their project's stage of completion.14 The application, which requires an abstract approved by the mentor, is typically due in late February.15 The symposium itself takes place in early April.14  
* **Awards and Recognition:** The symposium is not just a venue for presentation; it is also a competition. CURO presents "Best Paper Awards" in multiple categories, including "Technology, Engineering, and Math".17 Winning such an award is a significant distinction that provides a tangible marker of research excellence. The application deadline for these awards typically coincides with the main symposium application deadline.14

The CURO system is best understood as a cohesive curriculum for research development. The Research Award provides the seed. The Summer Fellowship provides the intensive cultivation. The Symposium provides the local harvest. And the Conference Participation Grant allows the student to take their product to the national market.

### **1.3. National Recognition: Prestigious Fellowships and Programs**

While institutional support provides the foundation for a research career, securing a nationally competitive award elevates a student's profile to the highest level. These programs are recognized by graduate admissions committees across the country as indicators of exceptional talent, motivation, and potential.  
National Science Foundation (NSF) Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Program  
The NSF REU program is the gold standard for summer undergraduate research in the sciences.3 The NSF funds numerous "REU Sites" at universities across the country, each of which hosts a cohort of approximately ten undergraduates for an eight- to ten-week immersive research program.3

* **Structure and Benefits:** Participants are integrated into active research groups, working closely with faculty and graduate student mentors on a specific project.19 These programs are fully funded, providing generous stipends (e.g., $600 per week at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County; a $7,000 total stipend at Cal Poly Pomona), and typically cover housing, meals, and travel expenses.19  
* **Focus Areas:** REU sites span all disciplines funded by the NSF, with numerous opportunities in mathematics and computer science.21 Of particular relevance is the NSF's explicit interest in fostering interdisciplinary research at the intersection of Computing, Mathematics, and Statistics.23 This alignment makes a well-conceived project in Topological Data Analysis (TDA) an exceptionally strong fit. Examples of relevant REU sites include programs in Smart Computing and Communications, Computational and Applied Mathematics, and AI for Computational Creativity.19  
* **Application Process:** Applications are made directly to individual REU sites, though the NSF is developing a centralized application portal.21 A typical application requires a CV, a statement of interest detailing motivations and long-term goals, academic transcripts, and two letters of recommendation from faculty members.19 Eligibility is generally restricted to U.S. citizens and permanent residents.19

The Barry M. Goldwater Scholarship  
The Goldwater Scholarship is widely considered the most prestigious and competitive undergraduate scholarship in the natural sciences, mathematics, and engineering.25 It is specifically designed to identify and support college sophomores and juniors who show exceptional promise of becoming the nation's next generation of research leaders.26

* **Award and Eligibility:** The scholarship provides up to $7,500 per year for up to two years to cover educational expenses.27 Eligible applicants must be full-time sophomores or juniors, be U.S. citizens, nationals, or permanent residents, have a high GPA (a 3.7 or higher is highly recommended), and demonstrate a firm commitment to pursuing a research career (typically a Ph.D.).25 Students planning to pursue an M.D. are generally not eligible unless they intend to pursue a research-focused M.D./Ph.D. path.27  
* **Nomination-Based Application:** A crucial feature of the Goldwater is that students cannot apply directly. They must be nominated by their institution.30 Each university can nominate a limited number of students (typically four), which necessitates a highly competitive internal campus selection process before the national deadline in late January.25  
* **The Research Essay:** The centerpiece of the Goldwater application is a three-page research essay that describes a significant research project the student has been involved in or a project they are proposing.25 This essay, along with the student's career goal statements and letters of recommendation, is evaluated based on the student's demonstrated potential for and commitment to a research career.27

For both NSF REUs and the Goldwater Scholarship, the application is more than a summary of accomplishments; it is a narrative. The most successful applicants are those who can articulate a compelling story about their intellectual journey, explaining how their coursework and prior research experiences have shaped their long-term goal of pursuing a Ph.D. and contributing to their chosen field.

### **1.4. Disciplinary Engagement: Opportunities from Professional Societies**

Engaging with the professional societies that govern one's chosen field is a mark of a developing scholar. These organizations provide critical opportunities for networking, dissemination, and recognition that complement university-based programs. For a student in mathematics and its applications, the following societies are key.  
American Mathematical Society (AMS)  
The AMS is a leading society for mathematical research. For undergraduates, its most important offering is the AMS Undergraduate Student Travel Grant. This program provides partial travel support, with awards up to $1,000, for undergraduate students who are presenting their research at the annual Joint Mathematics Meetings (JMM), the largest mathematics conference in the world.4 To be eligible, a student must be enrolled full-time at a U.S. institution and must have already submitted an abstract to present in a designated undergraduate session at JMM.4  
Mathematical Association of America (MAA)  
The MAA focuses on mathematics at the undergraduate level. While many of its grants are awarded to faculty to establish research programs for students (such as the National Research Experience for Undergraduates Program, or NREUP) 32, it also provides direct support to students through the  
**MAA MathFest Student Scholars Travel Grants**. These grants support students, particularly those from historically underrepresented groups, in attending and presenting at the annual MAA MathFest conference.32  
Association for Women in Mathematics (AWM)  
The AWM is dedicated to supporting women and girls in the mathematical sciences. While its travel grants are primarily for mathematicians who have already earned their Ph.D. 34, it offers one of the most prestigious undergraduate awards in the field: the  
**Alice T. Schafer Mathematics Prize**. This prize is awarded annually to an undergraduate woman for excellence in mathematics.36 A nomination for this prize is a significant honor, and winning it is a monumental achievement. The AWM also co-sponsors an essay contest open to undergraduates on the biographies of contemporary women in mathematics.37  
Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM)  
For students interested in applied and computational mathematics, SIAM is the premier professional organization. A key opportunity offered by SIAM is publication in SIAM Undergraduate Research Online (SIURO). SIURO is a highly respected, web-based, peer-reviewed journal dedicated exclusively to undergraduate research in applied and computational mathematics.38 Publishing a paper in SIURO is a capstone achievement for an undergraduate researcher and provides an exceptionally strong credential for graduate school applications.

## **Section 2: An Actionable Timeline for Funding and Engagement**

Understanding the available opportunities is the first step; knowing *when* to act on them is the key to successful execution. The academic world operates on a predictable annual cycle of deadlines. By internalizing this rhythm, a student can shift from being a reactive applicant, scrambling to meet deadlines, to a proactive strategist, preparing high-quality materials months in advance and aligning research progress with key application windows.

### **2.1. Immediate Opportunities: A Roadmap for the Current and Upcoming Semesters**

Based on a typical academic calendar, a strategic plan for the immediate future can be formulated. This roadmap provides a sequence of concrete actions to build momentum.  
Fall Semester (August \- December):  
The fall is a critical period for planning and preparation. The primary goal should be to secure funding for the upcoming spring semester and to lay the groundwork for major summer opportunities.

1. **Finalize Spring Funding:** The most immediate deadline is for the **CURO Research Award for the spring semester**, due on **November 1**.6 The application should be finalized and submitted well before this date. This involves refining the research proposal and securing the faculty mentor's commitment.  
2. **Prepare for Summer REUs:** Applications for **NSF REU programs** typically open in the fall and are due between January and March.6 The fall semester should be used to research potential REU sites, tailor the statement of purpose for each, and request letters of recommendation from faculty.  
3. **Begin Goldwater Preparation:** For eligible sophomores and juniors, the fall is the time to begin the **Goldwater Scholarship** application process. This involves understanding UGA's internal nomination procedure and deadline (often in late November or early December) and starting to draft the critical research essay.29  
4. **Plan for JMM:** The abstract submission deadline for the **Joint Mathematics Meetings (JMM)** is typically in September, with the deadline for the associated **AMS Undergraduate Travel Grant** in mid-October.4 Students with mature projects should target these deadlines.

Spring Semester (January \- May):  
The spring is a period of intense application activity and the culmination of the local research cycle at the CURO Symposium.

1. **Submit REU Applications:** Finalize and submit all **NSF REU applications** by their respective deadlines, which are often in late January or February.  
2. **Submit Goldwater Application:** The national deadline for the **Goldwater Scholarship** is the last Friday in January.29 Nominated students will work with UGA's fellowship office to polish their materials for this deadline.  
3. **Apply to the CURO Symposium:** The deadline to submit an abstract to present at the **CURO Symposium** is in late February.15 This is a critical step for all students conducting research at UGA, especially those funded by CURO awards.  
4. **Apply for Summer Funding:** The deadline for the highly competitive **CURO Summer Research Fellowship** is **March 15**.2 For those not applying for the fellowship or as a backup, the deadline for the standard  
   **CURO Research Award for the summer semester** is **April 15**.6  
5. **Present at the Symposium:** The **CURO Symposium** takes place in early April.14 This is the prime opportunity to present research locally, gain presentation experience, and compete for Best Paper Awards.

Summer Semester (May \- August):  
The summer is for focused research and planning for the next academic year.

1. **Conduct Intensive Research:** For students who secured a CURO Summer Fellowship or an NSF REU, this is the time for deep, dedicated research.  
2. **Present at Summer Forum:** CURO Summer Fellows must present their work at the **CURO Summer Fellowship Final Forum** in late July.12  
3. **Prepare Fall Funding Application:** The deadline for the **CURO Research Award for the fall semester** is **July 15**.6 This application should be prepared and submitted during the summer.

### **2.2. The Annual Research Calendar**

## **Section 3: Crafting a Compelling and Fundable Research Proposal**

A well-crafted research proposal is the single most important document in securing funding and mentorship. It is more than a summary of a topic; it is a persuasive argument that demonstrates the significance of a research question, the feasibility of the proposed methodology, and the student's capability to execute the project. For a student in mathematics, this requires a unique blend of demonstrating a firm grasp of established theory while outlining a clear path to explore the unknown, even when the final result is not guaranteed.41

### **3.1. The Anatomy of a Winning Proposal in Mathematics**

A strong research proposal, whether for an internal grant like CURO or a national program, follows a logical structure designed to answer the key questions of any reviewer: What is the problem? Why is it important? How will it be solved?.42  
1\. Introduction and Problem Statement:  
This section must immediately capture the reader's interest and establish the context for the research.44 It should begin broadly, introducing the general field of study, and then quickly narrow to the specific problem or question the project will address. A common mistake is delaying the statement of the research question; it should be clearly and fully articulated within the first few paragraphs.42 This section should explain the motivation for the research—why does this problem matter to the field? What makes it a compelling area for investigation?.45  
2\. Literature Review (Background and Significance):  
This section places the proposed work within the existing scholarly conversation.44 It is not merely a list of summaries but a critical synthesis of relevant literature. The review must demonstrate a thorough understanding of what is already known about the topic. Its primary purpose is to identify a "gap" in the current knowledge—an open question, an unexplored connection, or a novel application of an existing method.42 The proposal must clearly state how the proposed research will address this gap, whether by building on a previous study, applying a new methodology, or exploring a new domain.42 This section proves that the work is original and innovative, not a reinvention of the wheel.  
3\. Methodology and Theoretical Framework:  
This is the technical core of the proposal and must be exceptionally clear and detailed.42 In mathematics, this section must outline the precise plan of attack.

* **Theoretical Projects:** If the goal is to prove a theorem, the proposal should state the conjecture clearly, provide evidence for why it might be true (e.g., results in special cases, analogies to other theorems), and describe the mathematical tools and techniques that will be employed in the attempt.  
* **Computational Projects:** If the project involves developing an algorithm or running experiments, the proposal must describe the computational approach in detail. This includes specifying the datasets to be used, the algorithms to be implemented, the software environment (e.g., Python with specific libraries like giotto-tda or ripser), and the metrics for evaluating success.46

  The methodology must be detailed enough that another expert could, in principle, replicate the work.42 It is an argument for why the chosen methods are the most appropriate for answering the research question.43

4\. Timeline and Expected Outcomes:  
This section outlines a realistic plan for completing the project within the funding period.46 It should be broken down into key milestones (e.g., Month 1: Literature review and data acquisition; Month 2: Algorithm implementation; Month 3: Experimental runs and analysis). The proposal should also clearly state the expected deliverables: a new proof, a software package, a set of experimental results, a manuscript for publication, etc. Crucially, especially in theoretical research, it is wise to discuss potential challenges and alternative approaches—a "risk mitigation" plan that shows foresight and adaptability.41  
5\. Bibliography/References:  
A meticulously formatted list of all scholarly works cited in the proposal is required.42 This demonstrates engagement with the academic literature and adherence to scholarly conventions. The citation style should conform to the standards of the discipline.

### **3.2. Strategic Positioning: Leveraging Simplicial Complexes in TDA and AI**

The observation that funding agencies like the NSF show a strong interest in AI and TDA is a critical piece of strategic intelligence. For a student with a background in simplicial complexes, this is not a barrier but a significant opportunity. The key is to frame the research proposal in a way that explicitly connects this foundational mathematical knowledge to these high-impact, in-demand application areas. The DRP mentorship in simplicial complexes is not a detour from the proposed project; it is the essential prerequisite.  
The Conceptual Bridge: From Pure Math to Applied AI  
The strategic narrative to build is a three-step logical progression:

1. **Simplicial Complexes as Higher-Order Graphs:** A simplicial complex is a mathematical object that generalizes the notion of a graph. While a graph consists of vertices (0-simplices) and edges (1-simplices) that capture pairwise relationships, a simplicial complex also includes triangles (2-simplices), tetrahedra (3-simplices), and their higher-dimensional counterparts.48 This allows them to represent more complex, multi-way relationships within a system.50  
2. **TDA Uses Simplicial Complexes to Find the "Shape" of Data:** Topological Data Analysis (TDA) is a framework for analyzing large, high-dimensional datasets by probing their underlying geometric and topological structure.52 The fundamental process in TDA involves constructing a sequence of simplicial complexes on top of a data point cloud. For example, in a Vietoris-Rips complex, an edge is drawn between any two points within a certain distance threshold  
   r, and a triangle is filled in if three points are all mutually within distance r of each other.52 By varying this threshold  
   r, one creates a "filtration" of complexes that captures the data's structure at different scales. The main tool of TDA, called *persistent homology*, tracks the appearance ("birth") and disappearance ("death") of topological features—like connected components (β0​) and loops/holes (β1​)—across this filtration, summarizing them in a "barcode" or "persistence diagram".49 This directly applies the theory of simplicial complexes to extract robust, meaningful features from data.  
3. **Topological AI Uses Simplicial Complexes to Build Better Neural Networks:** A cutting-edge area of machine learning involves moving beyond traditional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which learn from pairwise interactions on graphs. **Simplicial Neural Networks (SNNs)** are a new class of deep learning models that operate directly on simplicial complexes.50 By passing messages not just between adjacent nodes but also between higher-order simplices (e.g., from a triangle to its bounding edges), SNNs can learn from the complex, multi-body interactions that simplicial complexes are designed to capture.50 This represents a powerful new direction in AI that is fundamentally rooted in topology.

Formulating a Fundable Research Question  
By leveraging this conceptual bridge, a student can formulate research questions that are both intellectually compelling and strategically aligned with funding priorities. The project is no longer "a study of simplicial complexes" but "an application of advanced topological methods to solve a critical problem in AI."  
Potential high-impact research directions include:

* **Project Title:** *Topological Characterization of Representation Manifolds in Deep Neural Networks.*  
  * **Research Question:** Can TDA be used to analyze the internal representations learned by a neural network? By treating the activations of neurons in a specific layer as a point cloud in a high-dimensional space, one could construct a simplicial complex and compute its persistent homology. How do the topological features (Betti numbers) of this "representation manifold" change during training? Do more robust or generalizable models exhibit different topological signatures? This project directly addresses the crucial AI challenge of interpretability ("explainable AI").  
* **Project Title:** *Early Warning Signal Detection in Financial Time Series Using Persistent Homology.*  
  * **Research Question:** Financial crashes are often preceded by subtle changes in market dynamics. Can TDA detect these changes? By using a "sliding window" to convert a time series into a series of point clouds (a technique called time-delay embedding), one can compute a sequence of persistence diagrams. Do characteristic changes in the topology of this point cloud (e.g., the formation of a persistent loop) serve as a reliable early warning signal for a market bubble or crash? This aligns with work being done in REUs on this exact topic.55  
* **Project Title:** *A Comparative Study of Simplicial vs. Graph Neural Networks for Link Prediction in Social Networks.*  
  * **Research Question:** Can an SNN outperform a standard GNN on a real-world task? The project would involve implementing a simple SNN architecture (building on recent papers like BScNets 50) and a baseline GCN. Both models would be trained on a public social network dataset to predict missing links (friendships). A systematic comparison of their performance would provide valuable empirical evidence for the utility of higher-order network representations in machine learning.

These project ideas are powerful because they are specific, feasible for an undergraduate, and sit squarely at the NSF-favored intersection of mathematics, computer science, and data analysis.23

### **3.3. Navigating Mentorship and Securing Strong Letters of Support**

Research, especially for an undergraduate working alone, is challenging without strong mentorship. The current situation with the DRP mentor provides both an opportunity and a need to expand the mentorship team.  
Engaging the Current DRP Mentor  
The DRP mentor is a crucial asset. Their role is not necessarily to supervise the applied project directly, but to attest to the student's mathematical maturity, intellectual curiosity, and capacity for independent work. The most effective strategy is to frame the proposed project as a direct and inspired application of the theoretical material they have taught. A student should schedule a meeting, present a draft of the research proposal, and frame the conversation respectfully: "The theory of simplicial complexes you've taught me has been fascinating, and it has inspired me to explore how these concepts are being used in data analysis and AI. I've developed this project proposal to apply these ideas. I would be deeply grateful if you would consider serving as my official faculty mentor for a CURO application, which would allow me to pursue this work." This approach validates the mentor's teaching, demonstrates the student's initiative, and clearly defines the mentor's role.  
Identifying a Project Co-Mentor  
Given the interdisciplinary nature of a TDA/AI project, seeking a co-mentor with expertise in the application domain is a wise strategy. This demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of collaborative research and strengthens the proposal by adding relevant expertise. UGA has numerous faculty whose research aligns perfectly with these topics.

* **UGA Mathematics Department:** The **Topology research group** is the most natural starting point.56  
  * **Professor Jason Cantarella:** His work on geometric knot theory and random knots involves the geometry and topology of complex spaces, showing a deep connection to the underlying principles of TDA.58  
  * **Professor David Gay:** His research in smooth and symplectic topology of 4-manifolds indicates expertise in advanced topological methods.58  
  * The **Applied Mathematics group** also has faculty with interests in machine learning and deep learning for data approximation.56  
* **UGA School of Computing:** The School has a robust AI research group.62  
  * **Professor Prashant Doshi:** A UGA Foundation Distinguished Professor of AI, his research focuses on decision-making under uncertainty and reinforcement learning.62  
  * **Professor Ninghao Liu:** His work on Explainable AI and Graph Analytics is directly relevant to a project analyzing neural network representations.62  
  * **Professor Jian Liu:** His research in Trustworthy AI aligns with using TDA to understand model robustness and security.64  
* **UGA Statistics Department:** The department has strong groups in Machine Learning and Big Data Analytics.65  
  * **Professor Yuan Ke:** His interests include Statistical Machine Learning.66  
  * **Professor Wenxuan Zhong:** As a UGA Athletic Association Professor, his work focuses on statistical methodology for big data analysis.65

When contacting potential co-mentors, a concise, professional email is essential.5 The email should have a clear subject line (e.g., "Potential Undergraduate Research Collaboration in TDA"), briefly introduce the student and their background, demonstrate familiarity with the professor's work, and clearly state the purpose of the email. Attaching the draft research proposal is a powerful way to show seriousness and initiative.  
Institutional Proposal Support  
UGA provides institutional resources to help develop stronger proposals. The Office of Strategic Research Development offers services like proposal editing, planning support, and workshops on grant writing.68 They also provide templates for various proposal sections.70 The  
**Jill and Marvin Willis Center for Writing** offers free consultations to all UGA students on any writing project, including research proposals and application essays.71

## **Section 4: From Research to Reputation: Publishing and Presenting Your Work**

Completing a research project is a major accomplishment; effectively communicating its results is what builds an academic reputation. For a prospective graduate student, a record of presentations and publications is the most compelling evidence of research capability. The path to dissemination should be as strategically planned as the research itself.

### **4.1. The CURO Symposium: Your First Platform**

The first and most important venue for presenting research is local. The **CURO Symposium** provides a supportive yet professional environment to gain presentation experience.1

* **Strategic Importance:** As noted, participation is expected for CURO awardees and is a prerequisite for priority consideration for future awards.6 It is the ideal place to practice presenting to a general academic audience.  
* **Preparing for Success:** A strong abstract is key to being accepted.14 The abstract should concisely summarize the research question, methods, results, and conclusions. Students must choose between an oral presentation (a 10-minute talk) and a poster presentation.14 For complex, visual topics like TDA, a poster can be highly effective. The ultimate goal should be to produce work of a high enough quality to be submitted for a  
  **Best Paper Award** in the "Technology, Engineering, and Math" category, as winning this award is a significant local honor that can be listed on a CV.17

### **4.2. Navigating the National Stage: A Guide to Undergraduate Conferences**

Presenting at a national or regional disciplinary conference is a major step up. It demonstrates that the research is of interest to a national audience of experts in the field. Funding for travel can be secured through the CURO Conference Participation Grant or grants from the conference organizers themselves.1  
Key conferences with strong undergraduate participation include:

* **Joint Mathematics Meetings (JMM):** As the largest mathematics meeting in the world, JMM hosts numerous special sessions and poster sessions specifically for undergraduate research, sponsored by the AMS, MAA, and SIAM.4 This is a premier venue for presenting mathematical research.  
* **MAA MathFest:** This annual summer conference also has a strong focus on undergraduate mathematics and features many student-focused sessions and events.75  
* **Nebraska Conference for Undergraduate Women in Mathematics (NCUWM):** Held annually in the spring, this is one of the most respected and well-attended conferences specifically for undergraduate women in mathematics.75  
* **SIAM Conferences:** The Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics hosts numerous conferences on specific topics in applied math and computation throughout the year.76 Submitting a poster to a relevant SIAM conference (e.g., on Computational Science, Data Mining, or Uncertainty Quantification) would be an excellent fit for a TDA project.  
* **Major AI Conferences:** Top-tier AI conferences like **AAAI**, **AISTATS**, and **NeurIPS** are highly competitive, but they often have poster sessions, workshops, or doctoral consortiums where undergraduate work can be presented.77 A successful poster submission to one of these venues would be an exceptionally impressive achievement.

### **4.3. The Undergraduate Publication Process: From Manuscript to Print**

A peer-reviewed publication is the gold standard of research achievement for an undergraduate. It signifies that the work has been vetted by experts in the field and deemed a novel contribution to knowledge. While the bar is high, several high-quality journals are dedicated specifically to publishing undergraduate research.  
**Top-Tier Target for Applied and Computational Mathematics:**

* **SIAM Undergraduate Research Online (SIURO):** This should be the primary publication target for a project in TDA or topological AI. SIURO is a web-based, peer-reviewed journal from a major professional society, devoted entirely to high-quality undergraduate research in applied and computational mathematics.38 The journal covers a wide range of topics, including modeling, computation, statistics, and optimization, making it a perfect home for interdisciplinary work.40

**Excellent Journals for General and Original Mathematical Research:**

* **Minnesota Journal of Undergraduate Mathematics:** This journal focuses on original mathematical research conducted primarily by undergraduates in all areas of mathematics and its applications.80  
* **Rose-Hulman Undergraduate Mathematics Journal:** This journal is devoted entirely to papers written by undergraduates on topics related to mathematics.39  
* **Involve: A Journal of Mathematics:** This journal is unique in that it is dedicated to showcasing high-quality research that involves students at all levels, bridging the gap between purely undergraduate journals and professional research journals.39

**Venue for Expository Work:**

* **Columbia Journal of Undergraduate Mathematics:** This journal does not accept original research but instead publishes high-quality expository articles. This would be an excellent venue for a paper that clearly explains the mathematical foundations of TDA and its connection to simplicial complexes, aimed at an undergraduate audience.81

The submission process for these journals mirrors that of professional journals, involving a rigorous peer-review process. This experience is in itself invaluable preparation for a graduate career.

## **Conclusion: Synthesizing Your Research Narrative for Graduate Admissions**

The ultimate purpose of this strategic engagement with research is to build a powerful and compelling case for admission to top-tier graduate programs. The goal is not simply to accumulate a list of awards, presentations, and publications, but to weave these accomplishments into a coherent narrative of intellectual development and scholarly potential.  
A successful graduate school application tells a story. In this case, the story is one of a student whose curiosity was sparked by the abstract beauty of pure mathematics—the study of simplicial complexes in a Directed Reading Program. This foundational knowledge did not remain abstract; it became the lens through which the student saw an opportunity to tackle pressing, real-world problems in the analysis of complex data.  
This led to an independent research project, validated and supported by a competitive CURO Research Award, that applied these topological concepts to the cutting-edge field of Artificial Intelligence. The project matured during an intensive summer of research, funded by a CURO Summer Fellowship or a prestigious NSF REU, yielding novel results. These results were first shared with the local academic community at the CURO Symposium, where the work was recognized with a Best Paper Award. The project's significance was further affirmed through its presentation at a national conference, like the Joint Mathematics Meetings, funded by a travel grant. The culmination of this multi-year effort was the publication of a peer-reviewed paper in a respected journal like *SIAM Undergraduate Research Online*.  
This narrative—supported at every stage by the tangible evidence of grants won, presentations delivered, and papers published—demonstrates not just intelligence, but also initiative, perseverance, strategic thinking, and a deep, sustained commitment to a research career. It is this complete package that distinguishes a good applicant from an exceptional one, and it is the outcome that this strategic guide is designed to help achieve.
