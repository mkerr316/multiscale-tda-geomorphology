## **Part I: The Methodological Frontier \- Advancing Analysis Beyond Standard Persistent Homology**

The confluence of high-resolution geospatial data, advanced computational methods, and novel mathematical frameworks has opened unprecedented avenues for understanding Earth's complex surface systems. At this intersection, Topological Data Analysis (TDA) has emerged as a particularly powerful paradigm, offering tools to quantify the multi-scale shape and structure inherent in complex datasets.1 However, the successful application of these tools, particularly in process-based geosciences, requires a nuanced understanding of both their profound capabilities and their inherent limitations. The initial challenge of predicting erosion rates at scale highlights a critical juncture not only in computational feasibility but also in methodological suitability. This section deconstructs this challenge, moving beyond the computational bottleneck to address the fundamental information captured by TDA. It then presents a strategic pivot towards a new generation of topological and spectral methods that are more attuned to the geometric and dynamic nature of Earth systems, establishing a robust methodological foundation for the frontier-level research questions that follow.

### **1.1 The Power and Pitfalls of Persistent Homology in Geoscience**

Persistent homology (PH) stands as the central pillar of TDA, providing a robust method for computing and summarizing topological features—such as connected components, loops, and voids—across a continuum of spatial scales.3 This approach has demonstrated significant value across a spectrum of scientific domains, and its application in the geosciences is a rapidly expanding frontier.

#### **Successes of Persistent Homology**

The primary strength of PH lies in its ability to produce stable and informative summaries of data's intrinsic shape, which are invariant under continuous deformations like rotation and translation and robust to noise.5 This makes it exceptionally well-suited for analyzing the often noisy and incomplete data characteristic of Earth observations. In environmental science, PH has been successfully employed to create interpretable models without the need for massive labeled datasets, a significant advantage over "black-box" deep learning approaches.7  
Notable applications demonstrate its utility. Researchers have used PH to classify the mesoscale organization of clouds from satellite imagery, distinguishing patterns like "sugar," "gravel," "fish," and "flowers" by quantifying their texture and geometric structure.7 In a similar vein, PH has been combined with machine learning to develop automated, threshold-free methods for detecting atmospheric rivers in large climate datasets, a critical task for understanding extreme weather events.8 Other applications include characterizing the complex shapes of landslides from LiDAR data 10, analyzing urban road networks 10, and even providing early warning signals for floods by analyzing time-series data.12 In each case, PH provides a unique, multi-scale descriptor that captures global structural information often missed by traditional statistical or pixel-based methods.13

#### **The Computational Bottleneck**

Despite these successes, a formidable obstacle hinders the application of PH to many large-scale geoscience problems: computational complexity. The standard method for constructing the necessary nested family of simplicial complexes from point cloud data is the Vietoris-Rips filtration. The size of this complex, and thus the time and memory required to compute its persistent homology, grows exponentially with the number of data points.14 This "curse of dimensionality" is a well-documented limitation in the TDA literature and presents a severe bottleneck for applications involving the dense, high-resolution datasets that are now common in geomorphometry, such as continental-scale DEMs derived from LiDAR or dense time series from Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR).14  
This computational barrier is precisely the issue that renders a project focused on predicting erosion rates at a meaningful scale intractable. To make such computations feasible, researchers are often forced to employ aggressive data reduction strategies. A common approach is subsampling, where a smaller, representative set of "landmark points" is selected from the full dataset.14 While necessary for tractability, this process risks discarding crucial information and introduces a new set of parameters that must be carefully chosen. The fundamental trade-off between computational feasibility and data fidelity remains a central challenge in applying PH to massive geophysical datasets.

#### **The Information Loss Problem**

Beyond the practical issue of computation, a more subtle and perhaps more profound limitation of standard persistent homology lies in its level of abstraction. PH is a tool of algebraic topology, a field of mathematics that studies properties of spaces that are invariant under continuous deformation. The classic example is that, to a topologist, a coffee mug and a donut are indistinguishable because one can be continuously deformed into the other; both are a torus with one hole, or a Betti number $ \\beta\_1 \= 1 $.5  
While this invariance is a source of robustness, it also means that PH is, by design, insensitive to a vast amount of geometric information. It can detect the presence, birth, and death of a topological feature like a loop, but it provides no information about its size, curvature, or orientation.15 This is a significant loss of information when analyzing physical systems. Geomorphic processes, for instance, are not governed by abstract topology but by concrete geometry and physics. Erosion is driven by gradients (slope), curvature, and the dynamics of fluid flow—precisely the kinds of geometric and non-topological information that standard PH discards.17  
This reveals a fundamental conceptual mismatch between the tool and the problem. Attempting to predict a continuous, process-based variable like erosion rate using a method that is invariant to the underlying geometry is an inherently difficult task. The failure of such a project is not merely a matter of insufficient computing power; it signals a deeper need for methods that can bridge the gap between abstract topology and the concrete, differential geometry that governs physical processes on the Earth's surface. The path forward, therefore, involves moving beyond standard PH to a new class of descriptors that enrich topological summaries with essential geometric content.

### **1.2 Advanced Topological and Spectral Descriptors for Dynamic Earth Systems**

To overcome the inherent limitations of persistent homology, the frontier of TDA is moving towards methods that integrate geometric information directly into the topological framework. These advanced descriptors provide a much richer characterization of data, making them far more suitable for analyzing physical systems where geometry is paramount. The most promising of these new approaches are rooted in spectral theory and differential geometry, particularly the use of Persistent Topological Laplacians.

#### **Introducing Persistent Topological Laplacians (PTLs)**

Persistent Topological Laplacians represent a new class of tools in TDA designed specifically to address the shortcomings of PH when dealing with complex data.19 PTLs combine the multi-scale perspective of persistence with the power of spectral methods to characterize both the topological and geometrical features of data.19  
The Laplacian operator is a cornerstone of mathematical physics, fundamentally describing diffusion processes like heat flow and appearing in wave equations and potential theory. In the context of TDA, a discrete version of the Laplacian can be defined on a simplicial complex. The spectrum (i.e., the set of eigenvalues) of this Laplacian matrix contains a wealth of information about the structure of the complex.  
A key insight is that the spectrum of a PTL can be divided into two parts:

1. **The Harmonic Spectrum:** The zero eigenvalues of the Laplacian (its kernel) correspond to the harmonic components of the space. The dimension of this kernel is precisely the Betti number. Thus, the harmonic spectrum of a PTL can fully recover the barcodes and persistence diagrams generated by standard PH.19  
2. **The Non-harmonic Spectrum:** The non-zero eigenvalues contain supplementary information that PH completely misses. This part of the spectrum captures geometric properties and details of the homotopic evolution of the data, such as how shapes are bending, stretching, or deforming through the filtration.15

By analyzing the full spectrum of a PTL, one moves from a simple accounting of topological features to a rich, quantitative description of the data's geometric and dynamic properties. This represents a paradigm shift from using TDA for static description to using it to define operators that can model physical processes. The Laplacian is the fundamental operator of diffusion; a *persistent* Laplacian, therefore, allows for the analysis of how diffusive processes operate across multiple scales on a complex landscape. This directly links the shape of the landscape to the physics of processes occurring upon it.

#### **Hodge Theory for Geoscientists**

A particularly powerful type of PTL is the Persistent Hodge Laplacian, which is built upon the principles of Hodge theory.16 For geoscientists, Hodge theory offers an exceptionally intuitive framework for analyzing flow processes on a landscape represented by a DEM. A DEM can be viewed as a 2-dimensional manifold or, more practically, a discrete cell complex. Vector fields, such as surface runoff or sediment flux, can be defined on this complex.  
Hodge decomposition provides a unique and orthogonal decomposition of any such vector field into three distinct, physically meaningful components:

* **Gradient (Curl-free) Component:** This represents irrotational, potential-driven flow. On a landscape, this is the component of water flow that is purely driven by gravity, flowing directly down the steepest slope.  
* **Curl (Divergence-free) Component:** This represents rotational, incompressible flow. This component captures vortices, eddies, and other circulatory patterns in a flow field that are not driven by a potential gradient.  
* **Harmonic Component:** This component is both curl-free and divergence-free. It represents flow that circulates around or through the topological "holes" of the domain. In a subglacial drainage network, for example, this would correspond to water flowing in a closed loop around a subglacial bedrock high.

This decomposition is a powerful analytical tool. By applying it to simulated or observed flow fields on a landscape, one can quantitatively separate the different physical drivers of transport. Standard PH can only identify the existence of the holes through which harmonic flow might pass; the Persistent Hodge Laplacian allows for the direct analysis of the flow itself.

#### **Applications and Potential**

While the application of PTLs and Hodge theory to geoscience is still in its infancy, their success in other complex domains demonstrates their immense potential. Persistent Laplacians have been shown to outperform persistent homology in challenging classification tasks like predicting protein-ligand binding affinity and analyzing gene expression data.19 In these applications, the additional geometric information captured by the non-harmonic spectrum proved crucial for distinguishing between subtly different configurations.  
Extrapolating to geomorphometry, one can envision numerous high-impact applications. For example, analyzing the Hodge decomposition of surface runoff simulated on a DEM under different rainfall intensities could reveal critical locations of flow convergence (high divergence) or shear that precede rill and gully formation. The evolution of the PTL spectrum of a deforming hillslope, derived from InSAR data, could provide a more sensitive precursor to landslide failure than changes in the Betti numbers alone. By moving beyond PH to these more sophisticated spectral tools, research can shift from simply describing landscape patterns to quantitatively modeling the physical processes that shape them.

### **1.3 Synergistic Frameworks: Bridging Topology and Machine Learning**

The true power of TDA in modern data science is often realized when it is not used in isolation, but rather as part of a synergistic framework with machine learning (ML).1 TDA-based methods can serve as a form of expert-driven, interpretable feature engineering, generating powerful descriptors of global data structure that complement the local, data-driven features typically learned by ML models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).7

#### **The Feature Engineering Power of TDA**

Modern deep learning models, particularly CNNs, have achieved remarkable success in image analysis tasks. However, it has been shown that they are often biased towards learning local features and textures, sometimes ignoring the global shape and structure of objects in an image.13 TDA, in contrast, is explicitly designed to capture this global, structural information. The features it extracts—the number and persistence of connected components, loops, and voids—are descriptors of the overall organization of the data.  
By combining these two approaches, one can create hybrid models that leverage the strengths of both. TDA provides a set of robust, global features that are transparent and deterministic, while the ML model provides a powerful, data-driven framework for classification or regression.7 This synergy is particularly valuable in the environmental sciences, where datasets can be small and interpretability is often as important as predictive accuracy.7

#### **Vectorization is Key**

A critical practical step in any TDA-ML pipeline is the conversion of the abstract output of persistent homology—a persistence diagram or barcode—into a format suitable for standard ML algorithms, which typically require fixed-length feature vectors.7 A persistence diagram is a multiset of points in the plane, and the number of points can vary from one data sample to the next, making direct comparison difficult. Several powerful vectorization techniques have been developed to address this challenge.

* **Persistence Landscapes (PLs):** This method transforms a persistence diagram into a sequence of continuous, piecewise-linear functions on the real line.21 Each point $(b, d)$ in the diagram, representing a feature that is "born" at scale $b$ and "dies" at scale $d$, is converted into a tent-like function. The landscape is the superposition of all these tent functions. A key advantage of this representation is that persistence landscapes lie in a vector space (a Banach space), which means they can be added, scaled, and averaged. This allows for the application of standard statistical tools; for example, one can compute the mean landscape for a collection of samples or calculate the variance within a class.21 This statistical tractability has made PLs a powerful tool, for instance, in detecting critical slowing down as an early warning signal for floods from time-series data.12  
* **Persistence Images (PIs):** This technique converts a persistence diagram into a fixed-size 2D array or image.19 The process involves rotating the diagram, applying a weighting function (often emphasizing more persistent features), and then superimposing a 2D Gaussian kernel at the location of each point. The resulting surface is then discretized onto a grid, yielding a pixelated image. This "image" can be flattened into a vector and used as input for standard ML classifiers, or it can be treated as an actual image and fed directly into the input layer of a CNN.23 This method has proven effective for linking microscopic particle arrangements to macroscopic properties in materials science.22

Other vectorization methods also exist, such as persistence surfaces, which are similar to PIs but use a different surface generation method 23, and Betti curves, which simply plot the Betti number as a function of the filtration scale.13 The choice of vectorization method can depend on the specific application and the ML model being used.

#### **Designing Hybrid Models**

The general pipeline for a hybrid TDA-ML model is modular and adaptable. It typically begins with raw input data, such as a satellite image or a DEM. The TDA branch of the pipeline computes topological features from this data and converts them into a vector representation using a method like PLs or PIs. This topological feature vector is then concatenated with other feature vectors. These other features might be traditional, hand-crafted indices (e.g., slope, aspect, curvature from a DEM), raw pixel data, or, most powerfully, the feature maps extracted from an intermediate layer of a deep learning model like a CNN.13  
This combined feature vector, containing both local, texture-based information from the CNN and global, structural information from TDA, is then fed into a final classifier or regressor (e.g., a Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, or a fully connected neural network layer) to produce the final output.13 This hybrid architecture has been shown to improve performance over using either TDA or a standard CNN alone in applications ranging from land cover classification in satellite imagery to medical image analysis.13 By thoughtfully designing such frameworks, researchers can build more robust, accurate, and interpretable models for complex geoscience problems.

## **Part II: The Thematic Frontier \- Identifying Viable and Impactful Research Arenas**

The methodological advancements outlined in Part I provide a powerful new toolkit for interrogating Earth systems. The strategic challenge is to apply this toolkit to scientific problems where it offers a distinct advantage. The initial focus on predicting erosion rates, a continuous process governed by fine-grained geometry, proved to be a mismatch for the abstract, topological nature of standard PH. A more fruitful approach is to pivot towards problems centered on classification, pattern recognition, and the detection of discrete, system-level changes—tasks for which TDA is exceptionally well-suited. This section outlines several high-impact, fundable research themes at the frontiers of geomorphology and climate science that are ripe for exploration with these advanced topological methods. Each theme is structured around a core scientific problem, a viable TDA-based methodology, and a tractable research target that avoids the pitfalls of the original project.

### **2.1 Characterizing Critical Transitions in Cryospheric Systems**

The cryosphere is characterized by profound nonlinearities, where gradual changes in climate forcing can trigger abrupt and dramatic responses, such as the rapid acceleration of ice streams or the catastrophic collapse of ice shelves. These events can be conceptualized as critical transitions or phase transitions, analogous to those studied in statistical physics.25 This framing makes them an ideal domain for TDA, which has been successfully applied to detect the topological signatures of phase transitions in physical models by analyzing the structure of their configuration spaces.26 By applying a similar lens to observational data from glaciers and ice sheets, it may be possible to identify topological precursors to these critical cryospheric events.

#### **2.1.1 Topological Signatures of Subglacial Hydrologic Networks and Ice Stream Stability**

**Scientific Problem:** The configuration of the water drainage system at the base of an ice sheet is a first-order control on ice dynamics. An efficient, channelized drainage system (like a subglacial river) can lower water pressure, increase friction at the bed, and lead to slower, more stable ice flow. Conversely, an inefficient, distributed system (like a thin film of water or a network of linked cavities) can lead to high water pressures, reduce basal friction, and enable fast, unstable ice stream flow.25 However, this critical system is buried beneath kilometers of ice, making its direct observation and characterization exceedingly difficult.27  
**Proposed Method:** A promising approach is to use TDA to infer the topology of the subglacial drainage system from geophysical remote sensing data. Airborne radar echo sounding (RES) surveys, for example, produce maps of basal reflectivity. High reflectivity is often interpreted as an indicator of subglacial water due to the strong dielectric contrast between water and ice or rock.27 Instead of merely mapping these bright spots, one can treat the reflectivity map as a scalar field and apply PH.  
The filtration would proceed by thresholding the reflectivity values. The resulting persistence diagram for 0-dimensional homology ($H\_0$) would quantify the multi-scale connectivity of the subglacial water system. A system dominated by a few long-lived (persistent) components might indicate large, isolated subglacial lakes, while a system with many short-lived components that quickly merge into one large component could represent a highly connected, distributed drainage network. The 1-dimensional homology ($H\_1$) could identify looped or braided channel structures. More advanced methods, such as Persistent Hodge Laplacians, could potentially infer dominant flow pathways from the geometry of the inferred network, providing a richer characterization than topology alone.  
**Viable Target:** The research objective would pivot from regression (predicting ice velocity) to classification. The central research question would be: *Can topological features derived from RES data distinguish between different ice dynamic regimes?* For example, can a machine learning classifier, trained on topological feature vectors (e.g., persistence images of the $H\_0$ and $H\_1$ diagrams), successfully classify regions of an ice sheet as either a slow-flowing interior, a stable outlet glacier, or a fast-flowing ice stream? This is a computationally tractable, scientifically novel question that directly links the inferred structure of the hidden subglacial environment to its observable dynamic expression. The necessary data, including RES data from NASA's Operation IceBridge and ice velocity products, are widely available.27 Furthermore, models of saline fluid flow, which can significantly alter drainage geometry and exist in cold-based systems, provide a means to test and validate these methods with synthetic data.29

#### **2.1.2 Topological Precursors to Glacier Calving and Disintegration**

**Scientific Problem:** Iceberg calving is a primary mechanism of mass loss for marine-terminating glaciers and a significant contributor to global sea-level rise.31 It is an exceedingly complex process involving ice fracture mechanics, stress imbalances at the terminus, and interactions with the ocean.32 Due to its stochastic and multi-faceted nature, calving is notoriously difficult to represent in large-scale ice sheet models, representing a major source of uncertainty in sea-level rise projections.33 A grand challenge is the identification of reliable precursors to large, catastrophic calving events, such as the collapse of the Larsen B Ice Shelf.33  
**Proposed Method:** This problem is an ideal candidate for analysis using *time-varying* TDA.34 The core idea is to frame a large calving event not as an isolated incident but as the culmination of a critical transition in the structural integrity of the glacier terminus. The state of this system can be represented by the geometry of its surface crevasse field. High-resolution satellite imagery or aerial photography can be used to map these crevasse patterns over time.  
For each time step leading up to a known calving event, the crevasse network can be converted into a point cloud or image. Applying PH to this data yields a persistence diagram that summarizes the network's connectivity and structure at that moment. By analyzing the sequence of these diagrams—a structure known as a "vineyard" or by tracking the evolution of persistence landscapes—one can search for systematic changes that precede failure.34 This approach directly parallels the use of PH to study phase transitions in physics, where changes in the topology of the system's state space signal the transition.26 For instance, the coalescence of many small, independent fractures into a single, through-going rift would manifest as a distinct signature in the 0-dimensional persistence diagram.  
**Viable Target:** The goal is not to predict the exact time and date of a calving event, which may be fundamentally chaotic. Instead, the target is to develop a topological "early warning signal," analogous to the concept of critical slowing down (CSD) used in other complex systems.12 The research question would be: *Do the persistence landscapes of crevasse networks exhibit statistically significant changes in their summary statistics (e.g., an increase in the L1 norm or variance) in the weeks or months preceding a major calving event?* This shifts the problem from a difficult regression task to a more tractable anomaly detection framework. The necessary data are increasingly available through high-cadence satellite constellations (e.g., Planet, Sentinel) and can be supplemented with GPS data on ice motion and seismic records of icequakes, which also signal fracture processes.36

### **2.2 Decoding the Topology of Fluvial and Deltaic Morphodynamics**

Fluvial systems are quintessential examples of natural topological structures. The branching and looping patterns of river networks are not random; they are complex structures that encode the integrated history of tectonic, climatic, and lithologic controls on a landscape.37 TDA provides a novel and powerful language to quantify this complexity, moving beyond traditional, scale-dependent geomorphic indices to create robust, multi-scale fingerprints of fluvial and deltaic systems.

#### **2.2.1 Beyond the Braiding Index: A Topological Framework for River Pattern Complexity**

**Scientific Problem:** The classification of river patterns into categories like straight, meandering, and braided is a cornerstone of fluvial geomorphology.38 Metrics such as sinuosity and the braiding index have been developed to quantify these patterns. However, these traditional indices are often scale-dependent, sensitive to measurement resolution, and fail to capture the full topological complexity of multi-threaded systems like braided rivers.39 For example, the standard braiding index simply counts the number of channels in a cross-section, treating a system with one dominant channel and many small anabranches the same as a system with several equally-sized channels. A more comprehensive, scale-invariant characterization is needed to forge a stronger link between river pattern and formative processes.  
**Proposed Method:** TDA offers a natural framework for this task. A braided river pattern, derived from a high-resolution DEM or classified satellite image, can be represented as a cubical complex (from a raster) or a point cloud (from digitized channel centerlines). Applying PH to this representation yields a rich, multi-scale signature of its topology.

* **0-dimensional homology ($H\_0$)** would track the connectivity of channel segments and the hierarchy of islands and bars. The persistence of these features would relate to the stability and scale of the bars that separate channels.  
* **1-dimensional homology ($H\_1$)** would directly quantify the "loopiness" of the network created by channel bifurcations and reconfluences. The number and persistence of these 1-cycles provide a direct measure of the degree and scale of braiding.

A particularly elegant approach would be to use a physically meaningful filtration function. For instance, the "sand function," which measures the volume of sediment separating any two points in different channels, could serve as the filtration parameter.41 In this setup, features that persist across a large range of sand volumes are topologically robust and likely represent major, stable divisions in the channel network.  
**Viable Target:** The research would not aim to create just another index. Instead, the goal is to use these rich topological fingerprints as input for a machine learning classifier. The research question becomes: *Can a classifier trained on topological feature vectors (e.g., persistence images derived from the $H\_0$ and $H\_1$ diagrams) successfully classify river systems based on their dominant process regimes (e.g., high sediment supply, low bank stability, high stream power)?* This approach directly links the abstract topological structure to the underlying geomorphic processes. The performance of this classification could be benchmarked against newer, more sophisticated indices like the entropic braiding index (eBI), which weights channels by their conveyance capacity.42 The required data, including high-resolution global DEMs like FABDEM and newly developed global river topology datasets, are now available to support such an analysis at a global scale.43

#### **2.2.2 A Data-Driven Morphogenesis of River Deltas**

**Scientific Problem:** River deltas are among the most dynamic and vulnerable landscapes on Earth, and their morphology is critical to their ecological function and resilience.44 The foundational model for understanding delta morphology is the Galloway (1975) ternary diagram, which classifies deltas based on the relative dominance of river, wave, and tidal processes.45 While conceptually powerful, this classification is inherently qualitative and often struggles to categorize the vast diversity of hybrid delta forms observed in nature. A quantitative, data-driven framework is needed to more rigorously test this long-standing hypothesis and to better predict how delta morphology will respond to future changes in sediment supply, sea level, and wave climate.46  
**Proposed Method:** TDA can be used to independently quantify the morphological signatures of the key deltaic components: the distributary channel network and the shoreline.

* **Channel Network Topology:** The distributary network can be extracted from satellite imagery and analyzed with PH. The $H\_0$ persistence diagram would characterize the branching hierarchy (e.g., the number of channel mouths), while the $H\_1$ diagram would quantify the degree of network connectivity and the presence of islands within the delta plain. A highly connected, loopy network is a hallmark of many river- and tide-dominated systems.42  
* **Shoreline Topology:** The delta shoreline can be treated as a 1-dimensional curve embedded in a 2D plane. Its complexity can be quantified using PH, capturing features like the roughness, crenulation, and the presence of embayments and protrusions across a range of spatial scales. This provides a multi-scale measure of the shoreline's geometric complexity, which is thought to encode the influence of wave and tidal processes.44

**Viable Target:** The objective is to perform a data-driven morphogenesis. The topological feature vectors derived from both the channel network and the shoreline for a global database of deltas would be used as input to an unsupervised clustering algorithm (such as the Mapper algorithm, UMAP, or hierarchical clustering). The central research question is: *Do distinct delta morphotypes emerge as clusters in this topological feature space, and how do these data-driven clusters align with, refine, or challenge the classic process-based Galloway classification?* This approach provides a quantitative and objective test of a 50-year-old hypothesis in geomorphology. It moves beyond subjective classification to a reproducible, data-driven framework for understanding the fundamental controls on delta form.

### **2.3 Topological Signatures of Geohazards and Landscape Disequilibrium**

This research theme returns to the analysis of hillslope and landscape-scale processes, but with a strategic shift in focus. Instead of attempting to predict a continuous rate variable like erosion, the goal is to use TDA to identify a *state*—such as a state of imminent failure or a state of disequilibrium. This binary or categorical classification framing is a much better match for the strengths of topological methods.

#### **2.3.1 From Motion to Mechanism: Identifying Spatiotemporal Precursors to Landslides**

**Scientific Problem:** Landslide prediction and early warning remain significant challenges in hazard science. A common monitoring technique is to track the displacement of single points on a slope using GPS or InSAR. While useful, this approach often fails to capture the crucial slope-scale organization and evolution of deformation that precedes catastrophic failure. A landslide is not a point process; it is the failure of a coherent block of material, and the formation of this block is a spatiotemporal process.48  
**Proposed Method:** This problem is an ideal application for time-varying TDA applied to spatiotemporal geodetic data. A time series of InSAR-derived ground velocity maps provides a sequence of snapshots of the deforming slope. For each snapshot (i.e., each time step), a filtration can be constructed by thresholding the velocity values. Points on the slope with velocities exceeding the threshold are included in the simplicial complex. As the threshold increases, more of the slope is included, with the most rapidly deforming areas appearing "first" in the filtration.  
Applying PH to this filtration at each time step generates a sequence of persistence diagrams. The evolution of these diagrams provides a dynamic signature of the deformation process.48 A key hypothesis is that the transition from distributed, incoherent creep to the formation of a unified slide block will be reflected in the 0-dimensional homology. Initially, one might see many small, independent components representing isolated patches of movement. As failure approaches, these patches may coalesce. The emergence of a single, highly persistent $H\_0$ feature at low velocity thresholds would signify the formation of a large, coherently accelerating mass—a direct topological signature of an impending failure mechanism.  
**Viable Target:** The research target is not to predict the exact time of failure but to classify the state of the slope as "stable" or "precursory." The primary research question is: *Can the Wasserstein distance—a natural metric between persistence diagrams—computed between diagrams from consecutive time steps serve as a robust anomaly detector for landslide acceleration?* A sharp increase in this distance would indicate a significant change in the spatial organization of deformation, potentially providing a warning signal long before any single point on the slope reaches a critical velocity threshold.48 This is a high-impact, computationally feasible project with a clear application in natural hazard mitigation. The necessary data, including global Sentinel-1 InSAR archives and landslide inventories for validation, are readily accessible.11

#### **2.3.2 Quantifying Landscape State: Topological Proxies for Disequilibrium**

**Scientific Problem:** A fundamental concept in geomorphology is the idea of landscape equilibrium, where the form of a landscape (e.g., its topography and channel network) is in a steady state with respect to the long-term rates of tectonic uplift and climate-driven erosion. Identifying whether a landscape is in equilibrium or in a transient state of disequilibrium is crucial for understanding its past evolution and predicting its future response to change. Traditional metrics, such as channel steepness indices, provide valuable but localized insights. A holistic, landscape-scale metric that captures the overall state of adjustment is needed.  
**Proposed Method:** This is a more conceptual but highly innovative research direction based on the hypothesis that the topology of a landscape's drainage network is a sensitive indicator of its dynamic state. A landscape that is rapidly responding to an increase in tectonic uplift, for example, might be characterized by a topologically simple network of steep, unbranched channels. In contrast, a mature, stable landscape might exhibit a more complex, finely-dissected network with a well-developed hierarchy of tributaries.  
PH can be used to quantify this network topology directly from a DEM. A filtration can be constructed based on elevation, where the landscape is progressively "flooded" from the bottom up. The resulting persistence diagram for $H\_1$ would capture the birth and death of basins as they connect, while the $H\_0$ diagram would track the merging of hills and ridges. Alternatively, a filtration based on flow accumulation could be used to directly probe the structure of the incipient channel network.  
**Viable Target:** The goal is to develop a *topological index of disequilibrium*. This would not be a direct prediction of erosion but rather a classification or clustering problem. The research question would be: *Can landscapes from regions with vastly different tectonic forcing (e.g., active mountain ranges, stable cratons, passive margins) be distinguished and classified based solely on the topological signatures of their drainage networks?* By correlating these topological feature vectors (e.g., persistence landscapes) with independent data on tectonic strain rates and climatic variables, one could develop and validate a novel proxy for landscape state. This moves the application of TDA from predicting a specific physical rate to a more fundamental characterization of the state of a complex geomorphic system. The necessary global datasets, including high-resolution DEMs (e.g., TanDEM-X) and models of tectonic and climatic forcing, are available to pursue this frontier-level question.

## **Part III: Crafting a Fundable Proposal \- From Research Question to Research Project**

Transforming a compelling scientific idea into a successful, funded research project requires a strategic approach. This involves not only formulating precise, testable questions but also aligning them with the priorities of funding agencies and outlining a clear, feasible plan for execution. The research avenues detailed in Part II offer a rich landscape of possibilities. This final section provides a blueprint for navigating this landscape, translating the identified thematic frontiers into the concrete components of a graduate-level research proposal. It begins by synthesizing the broad themes into specific questions, maps these questions to relevant funding programs, and concludes with a practical strategy for data acquisition and computation that directly addresses the challenges of scale and complexity.

### **3.1 Formulation of Specific, Testable Research Questions**

The foundation of any strong proposal is a set of clear, concise, and impactful research questions. Based on the analysis in the preceding sections, the following five questions represent viable and compelling directions at the intersection of TDA, geomorphometry, climate science, and computing. Each is designed to be scientifically novel, methodologically sound, and address a significant knowledge gap.

1. **Cryosphere \- Subglacial Hydrology:** How does the multi-scale topology of subglacial hydrologic networks, as quantified by the persistent homology of radar echo sounding (RES) data, correlate with observed ice stream velocity regimes, and can these topological features serve as a robust classifier for ice stream stability?  
2. **Cryosphere \- Glacier Calving:** Can the temporal evolution of persistence landscapes derived from crevasse fields in high-resolution satellite imagery provide a statistically significant early warning signal for catastrophic glacier calving events, framed as a critical transition in the structural integrity of the glacier terminus?  
3. **Fluvial Systems \- Braided Rivers:** Can a novel set of scale-invariant topological metrics, derived from persistent homology using a physically-based filtration, provide a more robust classification of braided river patterns than traditional indices, and how do these metrics correlate with formative process parameters like sediment flux and stream power?  
4. **Fluvial Systems \- River Deltas:** Does the application of unsupervised clustering to a topological feature space, derived from the persistent homology of both distributary channel networks and shorelines, yield a quantitative, data-driven morphologic classification of global deltas that refines or challenges the classic Galloway framework?  
5. **Geohazards \- Landslides:** Can the Wasserstein distance between persistence diagrams of successive InSAR velocity fields be used to develop a robust, automated precursor for landslide failure by detecting the spatiotemporal coalescence of deforming regions on a slope?

### **3.2 Strategic Alignment with Funding Agency Priorities**

Securing funding requires demonstrating that the proposed research not only has high intellectual merit but also aligns with the strategic goals of the funding agency. The interdisciplinary nature of the proposed research questions makes them suitable for a variety of programs across major U.S. federal agencies.

* **National Science Foundation (NSF):**  
  * **Collaborations in Artificial Intelligence and Geosciences (CAIG):** This program is an ideal target for several of the proposed questions, particularly those focused on landslides and glacier calving.50 A successful CAIG proposal must demonstrate a true partnership between a geoscientist and an AI/TDA expert. The proposal should be structured to explicitly address the program's three core requirements: 1\) **Geosciences Advancement** (e.g., a fundamentally new method for landslide early warning), 2\) **AI Impact** (e.g., the development of novel time-varying topological features for spatiotemporal data analysis), and 3\) **Partnerships** (e.g., a clear plan for cross-training students and integrating expertise).50  
  * **Geosciences (GEO) Core Programs:** Questions related to fluvial systems, delta morphology, and landscape disequilibrium would be highly competitive in the **Geomorphology and Land-use Dynamics (GLD)** program. The novelty of applying advanced TDA would constitute a strong argument for "Intellectual Merit." The question on subglacial hydrology could be well-suited for the **Office of Polar Programs (OPP)**, while the more conceptual work on landscape disequilibrium could also find a home in the **Structure and Physics of the Solid Earth (SPSE)** program, especially if linked to tectonic processes.51  
  * **EarthScope Program:** For research focused on North American case studies, particularly those involving large-scale continental deformation or plate boundary processes, the EarthScope program provides a relevant framework.52  
* **National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA):**  
  * **Earth Science Data Systems (ESDS) Programs:** The research questions rely heavily on NASA's vast archives of Earth observation data. A project framed around developing a new, scalable software tool for applying TDA to these archives would be a strong candidate for the **Advancing Collaborative Connections for Earth System Science (ACCESS)** program, which focuses on technologies to improve the use of NASA data.53 A project aimed at generating a new, consistent data product, such as a global topological classification of deltas derived from Landsat, could align with the **Making Earth Science Data Records for Use in Research Environments (MEaSUREs)** program.53  
* **National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA):**  
  * **Climate Program Office (CPO):** Research that connects changes in fluvial or deltaic morphology to climate variability and change would be of interest to the CPO. For instance, a proposal investigating how the topological complexity of river networks influences flood response under different climate scenarios could align with the goals of the **Earth System Science and Modeling (ESSM)** and **Climate and Societal Interactions (CSI)** divisions, particularly programs focused on water resources and coastal resilience.54

The following table provides a concise summary of these research avenues, mapping each scientific problem to its methodological approach, target outcome, data requirements, and most promising funding pathways.

| Research Area | Core Scientific Problem | Proposed TDA/ML Method | Viable Prediction/Classification Target | Key Datasets | Primary Funding Program(s) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Cryosphere: Subglacial Hydrology** | Poor characterization of subglacial drainage network connectivity and its link to ice dynamics. | Persistent Homology (0D, 1D) on RES data; potential for Persistent Laplacians. | Classification of ice flow regimes (stable vs. unstable) based on network topology. | RES (IceBridge), seismic data, ice velocity products (MEaSUREs). | NSF-OPP, NASA Cryosphere. |
| **Cryosphere: Glacier Calving** | Lack of robust, physics-based early warning signals for catastrophic calving events. | Time-varying PH on crevasse fields; Persistence Landscapes for time-series analysis. | Detection of precursory state transitions; anomaly detection in topological statistics. | High-cadence satellite imagery (Planet, Sentinel), seismic data, GPS. | NSF-OPP, NSF-CAIG. |
| **Fluvial Systems: Braided Rivers** | Traditional geomorphic indices fail to capture the multi-scale complexity of braided river patterns. | PH on DEMs using elevation or "sand function" filtration; unsupervised clustering on topological features. | Data-driven classification of river morphotypes; correlation of topological complexity with transport efficiency. | High-res DEMs (FABDEM, LiDAR), global river datasets (GRIT). | NSF-GLD, NASA-ACCESS. |
| **Fluvial Systems: River Deltas** | The classic Galloway classification is qualitative and needs a quantitative, data-driven update. | PH on channel networks and shorelines; Mapper algorithm or UMAP for clustering. | Generation of a quantitative delta morphospace; predicting vulnerability to climate change. | Global delta shoreline/network datasets (from Landsat archives). | NSF-GLD, NOAA-CPO. |
| **Geohazards: Landslides** | Need for slope-scale, mechanism-aware precursors to failure, beyond single-point displacement. | Time-varying PH on InSAR velocity fields; Wasserstein distance as an anomaly score. | Classification of slope state (stable vs. precursory); early warning signal generation. | Sentinel-1 InSAR archives, landslide inventories, high-res DEMs. | NSF-CAIG, NSF-Hazards SEES, NASA-Disasters. |
| **Geomorphology: Landscape State** | Lack of a holistic, quantitative metric for landscape disequilibrium in response to forcing. | PH on drainage networks extracted from DEMs; correlation with tectonic/climate data. | Classification of landscapes by tectonic setting based on network topology; a topological index of disequilibrium. | Global DEMs, global tectonic strain models, CMIP6 climate data. | NSF-GLD, NSF-SPSE. |

### **3.3 A Blueprint for Execution: Data and Computational Strategy**

A credible proposal must include a practical and efficient plan for data management and computation. This is especially critical given the initial project's failure due to scaling issues. The proposed research questions are inherently more tractable, but a robust computational strategy is still essential.

#### **Data Sources**

The proposed research leverages a wealth of publicly available, high-quality geospatial data. Key datasets include:

* **Topography:** Global, high-resolution DEMs are foundational. This includes products like the 30 m Copernicus DEM, the forest-and-building-removed FABDEM 43, the 12 m TanDEM-X DEM, and the high-latitude ArcticDEM.  
* **Ice Dynamics:** NASA's Operation IceBridge provides a rich archive of airborne geophysical data, including RES and laser altimetry. The MEaSUREs program provides consistent, long-term records of ice velocity from satellite radar. High-resolution surface elevation change can be derived from ICESat-2 laser altimetry.  
* **Geohazards:** The complete archives of Sentinel-1 InSAR data, available through platforms like the Alaska Satellite Facility, are the primary source for landslide deformation monitoring. High-resolution airborne LiDAR, such as from NASA's G-LiHT mission, can provide detailed pre- and post-event topography.  
* **Climate Data:** For correlating landscape features with environmental forcing, standard datasets like the CMIP6 climate model outputs and the MERRA-2 reanalysis product are essential.8

#### **Computational Pipeline**

A modern computational pipeline is required to efficiently process these large datasets.

1. **Preprocessing:** The computational cost of TDA is highly dependent on the type of complex used. For gridded data like DEMs and satellite imagery, working directly with **cubical complexes** is far more computationally efficient than converting the data to a point cloud and building a Vietoris-Rips complex. For point cloud data, constructing an **alpha complex** is often more efficient and geometrically faithful than a Vietoris-Rips complex. Where large point clouds are unavoidable, strategic, spatially-aware subsampling remains a necessary preprocessing step.14  
2. **TDA Software:** A mature ecosystem of open-source software is available for PH computation. For performance-critical applications with Vietoris-Rips complexes, **Ripser** and its parallelized version **Ripser++** are the state-of-the-art. For a more comprehensive library supporting a wider range of complexes and algorithms, **Gudhi** is the standard. For large-scale distributed computation, frameworks like **DIPHA** and **Perseus** have been developed. For image-based analysis, specialized packages like **HomCloud** are available.  
3. **Advanced Methods:** Research involving PTLs and Hodge decomposition will likely require more specialized code. This may involve using existing libraries for discrete exterior calculus or collaborating with applied mathematicians to develop bespoke implementations, which can be framed as a key intellectual contribution in a proposal.  
4. **ML Integration:** The vectorization of persistence diagrams and subsequent machine learning analysis can be implemented within the standard Python data science ecosystem. Libraries like giotto-tda, persim, and ripser.py provide tools for computing and manipulating persistence diagrams. These can be seamlessly integrated with mainstream ML libraries such as **Scikit-learn**, **TensorFlow**, and **PyTorch** for model building and evaluation.  
5. **High-Performance Computing (HPC):** While the proposed research questions are designed to be more tractable than large-scale regression, analyzing global datasets or long time series will still necessitate access to HPC resources. A proposal should include a clear plan for utilizing university or national supercomputing facilities for the most computationally intensive parts of the workflow.

By adopting this strategic approach—pivoting to methodologically appropriate scientific questions, aligning with funding priorities, and leveraging a modern computational pipeline—it is possible to formulate a graduate research project that is not only computationally feasible but also positioned at the cutting edge of geoscience and data science.

### **Conclusion and Recommendations**

The initial impasse encountered in predicting erosion rates should not be viewed as a failure, but rather as a critical diagnostic insight into the current frontiers of computational geoscience. It reveals a fundamental mismatch between the geometric, process-driven nature of many geomorphic problems and the abstract, topological language of standard persistent homology. The strategic path forward is not simply to find a smaller problem, but to embrace a more sophisticated methodological approach and apply it to questions where its unique perspective offers a distinct and powerful advantage.  
This report has laid out a comprehensive roadmap for such a pivot. The key recommendations are threefold:

1. **Advance the Methodological Toolkit:** Move beyond standard persistent homology. Embrace next-generation TDA methods like Persistent Topological Laplacians and Hodge theory that incorporate the geometric information essential for analyzing physical systems. This shift transforms TDA from a descriptive pattern-matching tool into an analytical framework capable of modeling the multi-scale physics of Earth surface processes.  
2. **Target High-Impact, Tractable Problems:** Reframe research goals away from the direct regression of continuous process rates and towards classification, pattern recognition, and the detection of critical transitions. The proposed research themes—characterizing cryospheric instability, decoding fluvial and deltaic complexity, and identifying geohazard precursors—represent high-impact scientific frontiers where the global, multi-scale perspective of TDA is not just applicable, but potentially transformative.  
3. **Adopt a Synergistic, Data-Driven Strategy:** Formulate research as an integrated TDA-ML framework. Use TDA as an expert-driven feature engineering engine to extract robust, global descriptors of shape and structure, and leverage machine learning to learn the complex relationships between these features and the process regimes or system states of interest. This hybrid approach is not only powerful but also aligns perfectly with the priorities of major funding initiatives like the NSF CAIG program.

By following this roadmap, a graduate researcher can formulate a project that is compelling, fundable, and scientifically profound. The challenge of scale is real, but it is surmountable with the right combination of scientific question, mathematical method, and computational strategy. The true frontier lies in using these powerful new tools not just to analyze data, but to forge a deeper, more quantitative understanding of the complex and dynamic systems that shape our planet.
