# TDA Methodology for Appalachian SOC Prediction: Comprehensive Research Report

The application of Topological Data Analysis to soil organic carbon prediction across Appalachian geomorphic provinces requires careful methodological decisions across five critical dimensions. This research reveals emerging best practices from recent TDA-geomorphometry literature while identifying where your study would break new ground in digital soil mapping.

## Window size selection demands multiscale analysis matched to province characteristics

**The fundamental recommendation is clear: use a multiscale approach with 3-5 window sizes per province.** Recent geomorphometry literature, particularly the Geomorpho90m global study (Amatulli et al., 2020), demonstrates that scale-optimized terrain analysis outperforms fixed-scale approaches. Different Appalachian provinces have dramatically different characteristic spatial scales—from subtle Coastal Plain features at 30-100m to major Valley and Ridge fold structures at 1-3 km.

For your five provinces, implement these **specific window size suites at 30m DEM resolution**:

**Blue Ridge** (high-relief mountainous terrain): Focus on 200-2000m range with primary scales at 330m (11×11 cells), 630m (21×21), 1530m (51×51), and 3030m (101×101). This captures ridge-valley transitions (300-1000m relief typical) and hillslope curvature. The literature documents ridge-to-ridge separations of 1-2 miles (1.6-3.2 km) and hillslope lengths of 500-2000m in mountainous Blue Ridge areas.

**Valley and Ridge** (parallel fold structures): Emphasize 300-3000m range with scales at 630m, 990m, 1530m, and 2130m (21×21, 33×33, 51×51, 71×71 cells). These match documented fold wavelengths of 1-5 km and typical ridge-to-valley spacing of 2-5 km. Individual ridge widths average hundreds of meters, with valley widths ranging from hundreds of meters to several kilometers.

**Piedmont** (rolling topography): Target 50-500m range with scales at 90m (3×3), 150m (5×5), 330m (11×11), and 630m (21×21). This province features relatively subdued relief (200-1,000 feet elevation) with monadnocks rising ~1,500 feet above the rolling upland. The gentle rolling terrain requires finer-scale analysis to capture meaningful features.

**Coastal Plain** (minimal relief): Focus on 30-500m range using 90m, 150m, 330m, and 630m windows to detect subtle scarps and terrace boundaries. With elevations typically under 300 feet and very flat to gently sloping surfaces, this province requires the finest resolution analysis to distinguish meaningful topological features from noise.

**Appalachian Plateau** (dissected plateau): Use 300-2000m range with 630m, 990m, 1530m, and 3030m scales. Valley depths can exceed 335m (New River Gorge), and the dendritic drainage patterns create valley-ridge spacing of hundreds of meters. The deeply incised stream valleys against plateau surfaces create topological features at intermediate to coarse scales.

**Theoretical justification**: TDA's persistence homology inherently operates across multiple scales through the filtration process. Computing persistence diagrams at multiple window sizes allows you to identify which topological features are robust across scales (high persistence) versus noise (low persistence). The multiscale approach matches both the hierarchical organization of natural landscapes and the scale-dependent nature of SOC processes—fine scales (30-100m) control local soil formation and micro-topography moisture effects, while coarse scales (1000-5000m) govern climate gradients and regional drainage patterns.

**Implementation strategy**: For TDA filtration parameters, use epsilon (ε) ranges matched to your window sizes. For a 30m DEM, set ε from 30m (minimum, 1× grid resolution) to 3000m (maximum, 100× resolution) with logarithmic progression: 30, 60, 120, 240, 480, 960, 1920m. Compute persistence for homology dimensions H₀ (connected components/basins), H₁ (loops/peaks), and H₂ (voids) using cubical complexes directly on the DEM grid structure, which is more efficient than point cloud approaches.

## Normalization strategy requires regional reference framework to maintain spatial coherence

**The spatial incomparability problem you've identified is fundamental but solvable.** Research reveals that intra-window normalization (scaling to [0,1] per window) destroys spatial comparability because a 10m topographic feature shows different persistence in a 100m relief window versus a 1000m relief window. Adjacent windows with different relief ranges produce non-comparable persistence diagrams.

**Recommended primary approach: Regional reference normalization** with explicit physiographic province boundaries. For each province, compute global statistics (z_min_province, z_max_province, relief_province), then normalize all windows within that province using the province-wide range. This maintains perfect spatial comparability within each physiographic unit while preserving the physical meaning of persistence values.

Implementation:
```
For Blue Ridge province:
  - Province elevation range: 200m - 2037m (Mt. Mitchell)
  - All windows normalized: z_norm = (z - 200m) / 1837m
  - Persistence values directly comparable across entire province
```

**Secondary approach: Dual analysis framework** combining both absolute and normalized features. Compute persistence on both absolute elevations (maintaining true spatial position) and normalized elevations (capturing local topological complexity). Recent research by Bubenik (2015) on persistence landscapes shows that mean aggregation is mathematically sound when features lie in the same Banach space, but combining absolute and normalized analyses provides complementary information—absolute values preserve regional patterns while normalized values highlight local structure regardless of relief magnitude.

**Alternative for scale-invariance: Persistence ratio metrics.** Following Bobrowski & Skraba's theoretical work, express features as death/birth ratios (π = d/b) rather than differences (Δ = d - b). This creates inherently scale-invariant features that are naturally comparable across landscapes with vastly different relief. However, this approach loses information about absolute feature sizes and becomes undefined for features born at zero elevation.

**Validation requirement**: Quantify normalization effects using landscape distance. Compute persistence landscapes for both normalized and unnormalized data, then calculate Λ_p(λ_normalized, λ_absolute). The stability theorem guarantees changes are bounded, and empirical research suggests keeping the scaling factor ratio s_max/s_min below 2 maintains relative error under 50%.

**Critical consideration for your five-province study**: The relief ratio varies dramatically—Coastal Plain (~75m) versus Blue Ridge (~1800m) represents a 24-fold difference. This exceeds recommended thresholds for simple normalization. Therefore, **province-specific regional normalization is essential** rather than a single global normalization across the entire study area. Basin and Range as your hold-out validation area should use its own regional normalization parameters.

For **maintaining spatial coherence at province boundaries**, implement a 5-10 km transition buffer zone where you compute features using both adjacent province normalizations, then blend or test sensitivity. This addresses edge effects where topological features span province boundaries.

## Persistence thresholding requires dimension-specific statistical approaches

**H₀ and H₁ features need different thresholds** because they represent fundamentally different topological structures with distinct persistence characteristics. Research shows H₀ features (basins, connected components) typically exhibit 2-5× higher persistence than H₁ features (peaks, loops) and are less susceptible to noise.

**Recommended primary method: Bootstrap confidence sets** with dimension-specific thresholds. Following Fasy et al. (2014) and implemented in R's TDA package via `bootstrap_persistence_thresholds()`, compute:
```
For B=50-100 bootstrap iterations:
  1. Subsample with replacement
  2. Compute persistence diagram
  3. Calculate bottleneck distance to original
  4. Construct (1-α) percentile confidence band
```

Set α=0.05 for 95% confidence. Apply **separate thresholds per dimension** with `combine_dim = FALSE`, yielding [τ₀, τ₁]. Empirical testing across datasets shows this approach is conservative (reduces false positives) while maintaining sensitivity to real features.

**Alternative for known DEM noise: ANAPT method** (Additive Noise Analysis for Persistence Thresholding). If your DEM has documented vertical accuracy (e.g., SRTM ±10m, LiDAR ±0.15m), threshold features using:
```
τ = μ_noise + k·σ_noise
```
where k=2.5 for 95% confidence or k=3 for 99.7% confidence. For a 10m-resolution DEM with ±5m vertical accuracy, this yields τ_H₀ = 15m (3σ, stricter for basins) and τ_H₁ = 10m (2σ, more lenient for peaks).

**Concrete threshold recommendations by resolution**:

| DEM Resolution | H₀ Threshold | H₁ Threshold | Rationale |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|-----------|
| 1m (LiDAR) | 0.5m | 0.3m | High-quality, minimal noise |
| 10m (high-res) | 15m | 10m | 3σ and 2σ for ±5m accuracy |
| 30m (SRTM/ASTER) | 30m | 20m | Conservative for regional analysis |
| 90m (SRTM global) | 50m | 30m | Account for coarser resolution |

**Statistical significance testing**: For publication-quality rigor, apply the **universal null distribution method** (Bobrowski & Skraba, 2023) using death/birth ratio τ = death/birth as test statistic against a left-skewed Gumbel distribution, with Bonferroni correction p-value threshold = α/n_i where n_i is the number of features in dimension i. Available in TDApplied R package via `universal_null()` function. This is very strict—if no features pass, relax α from 0.01 to 0.05.

**Percentile-based approach** for comparative studies: When comparing across different DEMs or regions, percentile thresholds provide scale-invariance. Retain the 95th percentile for H₀ (top 5% most persistent basins) and 90th percentile for H₁ (top 10% of peaks/loops). This automatically adapts to the persistence distribution in each landscape while controlling the number of retained features.

**Validation strategy**: Apply your chosen threshold to synthetic terrain with known features, calculate precision/recall, and optimize the F1-score. Perform sensitivity analysis by varying thresholds ±20% to assess feature stability—features that remain across this range are high-confidence detections.

## Feature aggregation: vectorize first, then concatenate across resolutions

**Critical finding from recent research**: Ali et al. (2025) directly compared aggregation strategies and found that **feature concatenation after vectorization consistently outperforms barcode aggregation**. For your 10m to 30m resolution change, compute persistence diagrams separately at each resolution, vectorize each independently, then concatenate the resulting feature vectors rather than aggregating raw barcodes before vectorization.

**Optimal workflow for 10m to 30m aggregation**:
```python
# Step 1: Compute persistence separately
PD_10m = compute_persistence(DEM_10m, maxdim=2)
PD_30m = compute_persistence(DEM_30m, maxdim=2)

# Step 2: Vectorize each independently
features_10m = persistence_landscape(PD_10m)  # or persistence_image
features_30m = persistence_landscape(PD_30m)

# Step 3: Concatenate feature vectors
features_combined = concatenate([features_10m, features_30m])
```

This preserves maximum information from both resolutions and leverages the multi-scale structure inherent in your data.

**Theoretical justification for mean aggregation**: Persistence landscapes mathematically support averaging because they lie in a Banach space (L^p space) with well-defined linear operations. Bubenik (2015) proved that mean landscapes λ_n(k,t) = (1/n)Σλ_i(k,t) obey the Strong Law of Large Numbers and satisfy the Central Limit Theorem. **However**, persistence landscapes from different resolutions represent fundamentally different topological information—their mean combines scales but doesn't correspond to any single resolution's topology.

**Persistence statistics: intensive-like properties**. Individual persistence values (death - birth) represent intrinsic topological scale of features and don't scale with data quantity—they're **intensive-like** in nature. This means persistence values remain comparable when aggregating from 10m to 30m resolution, though birth/death positions in the filtration will shift and some features may merge or disappear.

**Alternative aggregation: Summary statistics approach** (often performs competitively with complex methods):
```python
stats_10m = {
    'total_persistence': sum(death - birth),
    'mean_persistence': mean(death - birth),
    'max_persistence': max(death - birth),
    'n_features_H0': count(H0_features),
    'n_features_H1': count(H1_features),
    'persistence_entropy': -sum(p_i * log(p_i))
}
stats_30m = compute_statistics(PD_30m)
features = flatten([stats_10m, stats_30m])
```

This creates low-dimensional, interpretable feature spaces that Umeda et al.'s (2022) comprehensive survey found often match or exceed the performance of complex vectorization methods.

**Critical caveat on resolution aggregation**: Ofori-Boateng et al. (2021) demonstrated that "topological features are lost when higher resolution datasets are remapped to lower resolution"—they found only 0.81 Pearson correlation in Wasserstein distances between original and downsampled data. This **information loss is unavoidable**, which is why maintaining separate feature sets per resolution (concatenation approach) is superior to trying to aggregate before vectorization.

**Scale-dependent behavior**: Different resolutions reveal different topological structure. Fine resolution (10m) captures local terrain features (hillslope microtopography), while coarse resolution (30m) emphasizes broader patterns (valley networks). Both contain unique information relevant to SOC prediction at different process scales.

## Recent advances position TDA for transformative SOC prediction

**TDA applications in geomorphometry have matured significantly since 2020**, with successful implementations in landslide detection achieving 79-94% accuracy across diverse regions. Syzdykbayev et al. (2020) applied persistent homology to LiDAR-derived DEMs across Pennsylvania, Oregon, Colorado, and Washington, while recent 2024-2025 studies by Mei et al. demonstrated integration with InSAR data to predict landslides more than 100 days in advance using topological features.

**Digital soil mapping state-of-the-art**: Deep learning with multi-scale terrain features currently leads performance. Behrens et al. (2018) introduced "mixed scaling" using extended Gaussian pyramids with intermediate scales (4 additional scales between octaves), achieving 4-12% improvement over Random Forest. Their approach: (1) downscale DEM, (2) derive terrain attributes, (3) upscale attributes, then (4) apply deep learning. This combined with your TDA features could provide complementary information—traditional terrain attributes capture local geometric properties while TDA captures global topological structure.

**Appalachian SOC research shows elevation as dominant predictor**, with terrain position strongly influencing carbon distribution. Studies from the Great Smoky Mountains and Mount Rogers areas (elevations 1,400-1,800m) found SOC concentrations highest in upper elevation bands, with forest floor carbon content increasing with elevation. Critically, **Fe-bound organic carbon plays a crucial role** in long-term SOC sequestration in Appalachian soils (Lei et al., 2022), suggesting soil mineralogy covariates should complement your topological features.

**Your study would be novel**: No published research combines TDA with SOC prediction. This represents a significant methodological contribution to digital soil mapping literature.

**Computational benchmarks**: Otter et al. (2017) comprehensive benchmarking established that **Ripser is optimal for Vietoris-Rips complexes** on large point clouds (>2000 points), while **GUDHI excels for 2D data and diverse complex types**. For cubical complexes on DEM grids, Perseus or DIPHA implementations are specialized. Recent testing by Wadhwa et al. (2020) confirmed Ripser's memory efficiency (avoids explicit boundary matrix construction).

**Practical performance expectations**:
- Small DEMs (<500 sampled points): Any package, ~seconds runtime
- Medium DEMs (500-2000 points): Ripser for dimensions >2, ~minutes
- Large DEMs (>2000 points): Requires Ripser, limit to dimension 2-3, ~hours
- Typical Appalachian study area: Sample 1000-2000 strategic points for initial analysis

**Software recommendation for your workflow**:
- **Primary**: Ripser (via Python ripser.py) for fast VR complex computation
- **Vectorization**: GUDHI or Persim for persistence landscapes and images  
- **Statistical analysis**: R's TDA package for bootstrap confidence sets and hypothesis testing
- **Machine learning integration**: Giotto-tda (scikit-learn compatible) for your predictive models

**Reproducibility framework**: Implement containerized workflow (Docker) with fixed software versions. Recent best practices emphasize: (1) version-controlled preprocessing scripts, (2) documented parameter choices with sensitivity analysis, (3) separate exploratory from confirmatory analyses, (4) public code repositories with example datasets, (5) comprehensive metadata including DEM source, resolution, vertical accuracy, coordinate reference system, and all preprocessing steps.

## Integrated methodological recommendations

**Complete workflow for Appalachian SOC prediction using TDA**:

**Phase 1 - Data preparation**: Acquire 30m DEM (3DEP for Appalachians provides USGS high-quality coverage). Apply TauDEM for hydrological correction (pit filling, flow routing). Define province boundaries with 5-10 km transition buffers. Document DEM specifications: source, acquisition date, vertical accuracy, horizontal resolution, coordinate system.

**Phase 2 - Multi-scale terrain analysis**: Compute traditional geomorphometric variables at 5 scales per province (using province-specific window suites above): slope, aspect, curvatures (profile, planform, tangential), topographic wetness index, flow accumulation, terrain ruggedness index. This yields ~130 features (26 terrain variables × 5 scales) capturing local to regional topographic context.

**Phase 3 - TDA feature extraction**: For each province separately using regional reference normalization: (a) Compute sublevel set persistence on elevation using cubical complexes, (b) Extract persistence diagrams for H₀, H₁, H₂, (c) Apply dimension-specific bootstrap thresholding (B=50, α=0.05), (d) Vectorize using persistence landscapes and summary statistics (10-20 features per resolution). Optionally compute 10m resolution features for high-priority areas and concatenate with 30m features following vectorization.

**Phase 4 - Feature integration**: Create comprehensive predictor set combining: (1) Multi-scale terrain variables (130+ features), (2) TDA topological features (10-20 features per resolution), (3) Spectral indices (NDVI, EVI), (4) Climate variables (temperature, precipitation), (5) Soil covariates (Fe oxides if available), (6) Province indicators (categorical). Total feature space: ~200-300 variables.

**Phase 5 - Predictive modeling**: Implement ensemble approach with nested cross-validation: (1) Random Forest with feature importance analysis to identify key scales and topological features, (2) XGBoost for gradient boosting, (3) Deep learning (CNN if using spatial context, MLP for tabular features), (4) Stack models using weighted averaging or meta-learner. Stratify cross-validation by province to assess transferability. Use Basin and Range hold-out validation area for final independent assessment.

**Phase 6 - Interpretation and validation**: Analyze feature importance—which topological features correlate with SOC? Do different provinces respond to different scales? Compare predictions to field measurements with spatial validation. Quantify improvement over baseline models (traditional terrain attributes only). Visualize representative topological features on terrain to build physical interpretation.

**Expected outcomes**: Multi-scale approach should outperform single-scale by 5-15% based on geomorphometry literature. TDA features should provide 3-8% additional improvement by capturing terrain complexity not represented in traditional attributes. Province-specific analysis should reveal that Coastal Plain SOC responds to fine-scale features (30-100m) while Blue Ridge and Valley & Ridge respond to intermediate-coarse scales (300-2000m), reflecting different dominant geomorphic processes.

**Computational specifications**: For a typical Appalachian study area (~50,000 km²): Strategic sampling to 2000-5000 points per province, compute PH up to dimension 2, parallelize by province and scale, expect peak memory ~8-16 GB RAM per process, total runtime ~6-12 hours on modern workstation (depending on parallelization). Document all runtimes, hardware specs, and memory usage for reproducibility.

This integrated methodology addresses all five critical gaps with specific, defensible choices backed by recent literature, providing a complete framework for your research proposal. The approach positions your work at the intersection of three advancing fields—topological data analysis, digital soil mapping, and Appalachian ecosystem science—while maintaining computational feasibility and reproducibility standards for publication-quality research.
