## **Part I: The Geomorphic and Hydrologic Basis for Covariate Selection**

### **Section 1\. The Digital Terrain Paradigm in Geomorphology**

The quantitative analysis of Earth's surface, a field known as geomorphometry, has been fundamentally transformed by the advent of digital terrain modeling.1 The discipline, which draws from earth science, mathematics, and computer science, has shifted from qualitative description to quantitative characterization, a revolution driven by the computer manipulation of gridded terrain heights, or digital elevation models (DEMs).1 A DEM is not merely a dataset; it is a numerical representation of the ground-surface relief that serves as the foundational layer for modeling a vast array of surface processes, from hillslope erosion to watershed hydrology.3 The transition to DEM-based analysis has enabled the routine inclusion of sophisticated terrain modeling in geographic information systems (GIS), allowing for the characterization of entire landscapes rather than just small, isolated field sites.1

#### **The Primacy of the Digital Elevation Model (DEM)**

The DEM is the primary data source from which all topographic information is derived. Its structure, typically a raster grid of elevation values, provides the necessary input for algorithms that calculate a suite of land-surface parameters (LSPs)—quantitative descriptors of topography such as slope, aspect, and curvature.5 The power of the DEM lies in its ability to support the automated extraction of these parameters, which in turn are used to infer the processes shaping the landscape.3 This analytical workflow, from data collection to surface analysis and application, forms the core of modern geomorphometry.2 The ultimate goal is to use these quantitative measures of morphology to understand the age, origin, and evolution of the landscape, as topography represents the dynamic interplay between climate, tectonics, and surface processes.2

#### **Data Sources and Quality**

The utility of any geomorphometric analysis is contingent upon the quality of the underlying DEM. The proliferation of high-resolution topographic data from advanced remote sensing technologies has been a key enabler of progress in the field.1 Several public repositories provide access to high-quality, wall-to-wall elevation data. In the United States, the U.S. Geological Survey's (USGS) 3D Elevation Program (3DEP) is the premier source, offering seamless DEMs derived from high-resolution light detection and ranging (lidar) data at resolutions of 1/3 arc-second (\~10 m) and 1 meter, among others.8 These products represent the bare-earth surface, with vegetation and buildings removed, making them ideal for geomorphic analysis.12 For global applications, datasets such as the Copernicus DEM have been shown to provide very high-quality landscape representation, often superior to older global datasets like the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) DEM or the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) Global DEM.4  
The resolution and vertical accuracy of the source DEM are of paramount importance. These characteristics directly constrain the scale of features and processes that can be reliably analyzed.4 Errors or artifacts in the DEM, such as those caused by dense vegetation in lidar returns or processing artifacts in radar-derived models, can propagate and amplify through the calculation of derivative LSPs, leading to erroneous interpretations.14 Therefore, the selection of the highest quality available DEM is the critical first step in any rigorous geomorphometric workflow.

#### **Land-Surface Parameters (LSPs)**

LSPs are the quantitative metrics derived from a DEM that describe the morphology of the land surface.5 They can be categorized as primary attributes, which are direct geometric derivatives (e.g., slope, aspect, curvature), and secondary or compound attributes, which combine primary attributes to model specific processes (e.g., Topographic Wetness Index, Stream Power Index).14  
A crucial and recurring theme in geomorphometry is the scale-dependency of LSPs.5 Nearly all LSPs exhibit a strong dependence on the scale of analysis, which is defined by both the resolution (cell size) of the DEM and the extent (neighborhood size) over which the parameter is calculated.4 This is not a methodological flaw but a fundamental property of landscapes. The scale at which an LSP is measured specifies which landforms and processes are being characterized.5 For instance, slope calculated over a 3x3 window on a 1-meter DEM reflects micro-topography relevant to soil creep, whereas slope calculated over a larger window on a 30-meter DEM reflects the overall hillslope gradient relevant to landslide potential. This inherent multiscale nature of topography necessitates a careful and deliberate approach to both the calculation and interpretation of LSPs, a topic that will be explored in greater detail in Part II of this report.

### **Section 2\. Interpreting Primary Topographic Form for Process Inference**

The fundamental geometric properties of the land surface—its gradient, local relief, and curvature—are the primary indicators of geomorphic process. These primary LSPs serve as the foundational balancing covariates in a spatial sampling design because they stratify the landscape according to its basic physical state, which in turn governs the distribution of energy and materials.

#### **Slope Gradient**

Slope, defined as the maximum rate of change in elevation, is the most elemental LSP.16 Geomorphologically, it represents the local gravitational potential energy gradient. As such, it is a first-order control on a vast range of surface processes. It governs the velocity and erosive power of overland flow, influences the rate of downslope soil transport through processes like soil creep and rainsplash, and is a critical factor in determining slope stability and landslide susceptibility.17 Slopes can be classified based on their origin, such as endogenetic slopes formed by tectonic activity (e.g., fault scarps) or exogenetic slopes shaped by erosional and depositional processes.18 In a sampling framework, slope gradient serves to stratify the landscape into domains of differing energy regimes, from low-energy depositional plains to high-energy, erosional mountain fronts.

#### **Local Relief**

Local relief, typically calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum elevation within a defined moving window, provides a measure of the vertical dissection or ruggedness of the terrain.4 Unlike slope, which is a point derivative calculated over an immediate neighborhood (e.g., 3x3 cells), relief captures a broader, texture-based characteristic of the landscape.4 It is a key metric in tectonic geomorphology, where it is used to assess the interplay between rates of tectonic uplift and fluvial incision.6 Landscapes with high local relief are generally indicative of active uplift and rapid erosion, while low-relief surfaces may represent older, more stable planation surfaces.4 As a covariate, local relief helps to stratify the landscape by its stage of geomorphic evolution and overall erosional intensity.

#### **Surface Curvature: A Critical Examination**

Surface curvature quantifies the rate of change of slope or aspect, providing a second-derivative measure of the land surface that is fundamental to characterizing landform elements and inferring process dynamics.15 The two most common forms, profile and plan curvature, have distinct and complementary geomorphic interpretations.

* **Geomorphic Significance of Curvatures**: **Profile curvature** is measured in the direction of the steepest slope (i.e., along a flow line). It describes the acceleration and deceleration of downslope flows of water, soil, and debris.15 Convex profiles (positive curvature in some GIS conventions) are associated with flow acceleration and erosion, while concave profiles (negative curvature) are associated with flow deceleration and deposition.16  
  **Plan curvature** is measured perpendicular to the slope direction (i.e., parallel to a contour line). It describes the convergence and divergence of flow.15 Convergent planforms (concave, positive curvature in some conventions) concentrate flow, leading to the formation of hollows and channels, while divergent planforms (convex, negative curvature) disperse flow, characteristic of noses and ridges.15 Together, these curvatures are powerful tools for landform classification and process modeling, allowing for the identification of peaks, pits, channels, and ridges, and for inferring the dominant modes of material transport.16  
* **The Implementation and Interpretation Crisis**: Despite their theoretical importance, the practical application of curvature metrics is fraught with ambiguity and inconsistency. A significant and often-underappreciated issue is the lack of standardization in the definition, calculation, and sign convention of curvature across major GIS software packages.15 For example, the sign convention for profile curvature in ArcGIS is the opposite of that in SAGA GIS, meaning a positive value indicates a concave surface in one and a convex surface in the other.15 Similar inconsistencies exist for plan curvature.15

This problem stems from a deeper confusion between mathematical and geographical conventions. In differential geometry, a bowl-shaped surface (a dell) is mathematically convex (positive curvature), while a dome-shaped surface (a hill) is mathematically concave (negative curvature).20 Geomorphologists, however, intuitively describe hills as convex and dells as concave. Many GIS implementations mix these conventions, leading to a "curvature crisis" where the same named variable can have opposite meanings depending on the software used.20 This severely undermines the reproducibility and comparability of scientific studies that rely on these standard tools. A model trained using "profile curvature" from one software package may produce entirely different results if run with the same-named variable from another.  
This unreliability of a supposedly fundamental covariate creates a strong scientific and practical impetus to seek more robust, less ambiguous methods for characterizing landscape form. While one could meticulously document the specific algorithm and sign convention used, a more powerful approach is to adopt metrics that are less sensitive to these point-wise derivative calculations. This motivates the use of multiscale methods, discussed in Part II, which analyze patterns over larger neighborhoods and can capture the essence of topographic form (e.g., roughness, texture) in a more stable and reproducible manner. The inherent ambiguity of standard curvature metrics serves as a primary justification for moving toward these more advanced analytical techniques.

### **Section 3\. Modeling Surface Processes with Geomorphic Indices**

Beyond primary derivatives of topography, a suite of compound or secondary indices has been developed to model specific physical processes operating on the landscape. These indices combine primary LSPs into physically meaningful expressions that serve as proxies for complex environmental variables like soil moisture or erosive force. When used as covariates in a sampling design, they allow for stratification based on hypothesized process domains. However, it is critical to recognize that these indices are not direct measurements of a process but are themselves models, each with a set of underlying assumptions. Their inclusion in a sampling framework is therefore not merely a technical step but an explicit a priori hypothesis about the dominant processes controlling the spatial variance of the variable of interest in the study landscape.

#### **Topographic Wetness Index (TWI)**

* **Theory and Application**: The Topographic Wetness Index (TWI), also known as the Compound Topographic Index (CTI), is one of the most widely used hydrologically-based covariates in environmental science.14 It is defined as:

TWI=ln(tanβa​)  
where a is the specific upslope contributing area (the upslope area per unit contour length) and tanβ is the local slope gradient.22 The index is designed to quantify the effect of topography on the spatial distribution of soil moisture. The numerator,  
a, serves as a proxy for the amount of water flowing to a given point from upslope areas, while the denominator, tanβ, represents the local capacity to drain that water away.23 High TWI values are expected in convergent, low-gradient landscape positions (like valley bottoms and hollows), indicating a tendency to accumulate water and become saturated. Conversely, low TWI values occur on steep, divergent slopes (like ridges and noses), indicating well-drained conditions.22 Because of this intuitive physical basis, TWI is extensively used as a covariate for predicting the spatial patterns of soil properties, vegetation communities, and hydrological responsiveness.22

* **Limitations and Sensitivity**: The utility of TWI is subject to several important limitations. First, its performance is highly sensitive to the resolution and pre-processing of the input DEM.23 Studies have shown that TWI calculated from raw, high-resolution DEMs (e.g., 1-meter lidar) often performs poorly because micro-topographic "noise" creates complex, unrealistic flow paths that do not reflect the broader landform controls on hydrology.23 Consequently, DEM generalization through filtering or resampling is often a necessary pre-processing step to improve the correlation between TWI and measured soil moisture.23 Second, the underlying model assumes a steady-state condition where shallow, subsurface flow is parallel to the ground surface.24 This assumption is frequently violated, particularly in low-relief landscapes where regional groundwater gradients, rather than local surface topography, dominate wetness patterns.24 In such environments, TWI is not a relevant variable. Finally, the relationship between TWI and actual soil moisture is dynamic; it is strongest under moderately wet conditions and degrades during very dry periods (when soil texture may be a stronger control) or fully saturated periods (when soil porosity is the limiting factor).23

#### **Stream Power Index (SPI)**

* **Theory and Application**: The Stream Power Index (SPI) is a direct measure of the potential erosive power of concentrated overland flow.29 It is typically calculated as:

SPI=a⋅tanβ  
where a is the specific contributing area and tanβ is the slope gradient.30 The index represents the capacity of water flow to do geomorphic work, namely to detach and transport sediment. It is therefore invaluable for applications related to flood modeling, river restoration, and identifying areas susceptible to gully erosion.29

* **Geomorphic Interpretation**: As a process-based metric, SPI provides a clear geomorphic interpretation. High SPI values are found in locations where a large contributing area converges on a steep slope, such as at the heads of channels or in constricted valley bottoms. These are the zones where fluvial erosion is expected to be most active. In a sampling design, SPI serves as a powerful covariate to stratify the landscape into areas of high and low fluvial process intensity. This is particularly useful for studies focused on soil erosion, sediment dynamics, landscape evolution, or the distribution of riparian habitats that are controlled by flood disturbance regimes.

## **Part II: Advanced Analytical Frameworks for Deriving Novel Covariates**

While primary LSPs and standard process indices provide a foundational understanding of the landscape, they are often limited by their single-scale nature and their focus on local, point-wise properties. To capture the more complex, multiscale, and structural characteristics of geomorphic systems, more advanced analytical frameworks are required. This section explores two such frameworks—multiscale analysis via wavelets and scale-space theory, and the quantification of landscape shape using Topological Data Analysis (TDA)—that can generate novel and powerful covariates for informing a sophisticated spatial sampling design.

### **Section 4\. Characterizing Landscape Texture and Structure Across Scales**

A fundamental principle of modern geomorphology is that landforms and the processes that create them are inherently multiscale.33 A landform such as a hillslope, for example, can be characterized by its overall gradient (a broad-scale feature), the rills and gullies incised upon its surface (intermediate-scale features), and the micro-topography of its soil surface (a fine-scale feature). Analyzing the landscape at a single, arbitrary scale—as is implicitly done when using a single-resolution DEM and a fixed-size calculation window—risks mischaracterizing these nested relationships or missing the characteristic scales of the phenomena of interest entirely.5 Multiscale analysis provides a formal framework for overcoming this limitation by systematically examining topographic patterns across a continuous or discrete range of spatial scales.35

#### **4.1. Wavelet-Based Terrain Decomposition**

* **Principles**: Wavelet analysis is a powerful mathematical technique for decomposing a signal—in this case, the one-dimensional profile or two-dimensional surface of a DEM—into its constituent components at different spatial frequencies (scales) and locations.33 Unlike the Fourier transform, which provides frequency information but loses all spatial localization, the wavelet transform provides a joint space-frequency (or space-scale) representation.33 This is achieved by convolving the DEM with a small, wave-like function (the "mother wavelet") that is systematically stretched (dilated) to analyze different scales and shifted (translated) to analyze different locations.34 The result is a set of wavelet coefficients that quantify the intensity of topographic variation at each scale and location.39  
* **Application in Geomorphology**: In geomorphology, wavelet transforms are an exceptionally effective tool for multiscale terrain analysis.33 By separating the DEM into different frequency bands, the analysis can distinguish broad-scale landforms (represented by low-frequency "approximation" coefficients) from fine-scale surface texture and discontinuities (represented by high-frequency "detail" coefficients).34 This decomposition has several powerful applications:  
  * **Robust Roughness Metrics**: The detail coefficients from the wavelet transform provide a direct and robust measure of terrain roughness or complexity at a specific scale.39 By summing or averaging these coefficients, one can generate a multiscale roughness map that serves as a powerful covariate, capturing surface texture in a way that is more stable and less ambiguous than standard curvature metrics.39  
  * **Feature Detection**: Wavelet analysis excels at detecting "hidden" geodiversity—subtle geological or geomorphological structures that have been muted by long-term erosion or are obscured by vegetation cover.39 Because wavelets are sensitive to discontinuities, they can highlight faint fault scarps, ancient landslide features, or folded bedrock structures that are not apparent in standard visualizations of the DEM.33  
  * **Generating Covariates**: The outputs of wavelet analysis can be directly used to generate novel covariates for spatial prediction and sampling. For instance, in digital soil mapping, the mean and standard deviation of wavelet coefficients at various decomposition levels have been used as effective predictors of soil properties, capturing contextual landscape information that point-based covariates miss.41

#### **4.2. The Gaussian Scale-Space Framework**

* **Principles**: An alternative but related framework for multiscale analysis is provided by Gaussian scale-space theory.5 The core idea is to generate representations of a signal at multiple scales by convolving it with a Gaussian kernel of progressively larger standard deviation (  
  σ).5 The parameter  
  σ serves as a continuous scale parameter. Applying this to a DEM creates a "stack" of increasingly smoothed versions of the topography, where fine-scale features are gradually filtered out, leaving only the broader-scale forms.5  
* **Advantages**: The Gaussian scale-space framework offers several desirable properties for geomorphometric analysis. It is mathematically well-posed, ensuring that no new spurious features are created as the scale increases.5 It provides a truly continuous scale parameter, allowing for a more detailed exploration of scale effects than the discrete, dyadic scales often used in wavelet analysis. Furthermore, it avoids the blocky artifacts that can result from simple DEM resampling or aggregation methods.5 LSPs such as slope and curvature can be calculated at each level of this scale-space, enabling a systematic investigation of how their statistical distributions and spatial patterns change with the scale of observation. This process can reveal "characteristic scales" in the landscape, identified as peaks in the rate of change of local variance, which may correspond to the dominant scales of specific landform elements.44

### **Section 5\. Quantifying Landscape Shape with Topological Data Analysis (TDA)**

While multiscale analysis provides a powerful lens for examining landscape texture, Topological Data Analysis (TDA) offers a fundamentally different and complementary approach. TDA is a rapidly emerging field of applied mathematics that uses concepts from algebraic topology to quantify the "shape," connectivity, and structure of complex data.45 For geospatial data, which is often high-dimensional, noisy, and incomplete, TDA provides a robust framework for dimensionality reduction and feature extraction that is insensitive to the specific choice of metric.45 The central premise of TDA is that the underlying shape of a dataset contains essential information.49 For a landscape represented by a DEM, this "shape" refers to the intricate arrangement of ridges, valleys, peaks, and pits that constitute the geomorphic fabric.  
A key distinction between TDA-derived metrics and traditional LSPs is that the latter typically measure local magnitudes (e.g., the steepness or curvature at a point), whereas TDA quantifies the properties of *arrangement* and *connectivity*. Geomorphic systems are defined by their structure—a drainage network is a connected tree, not just an assortment of high-curvature cells. TDA is explicitly designed to capture these higher-order structural properties, such as how landscape elements are connected, what loops they form (e.g., ridges enclosing a basin), and what voids they contain.47 This provides a new class of information for stratifying a landscape based on its geomorphic organization and complexity, potentially capturing sources of variance that are invisible to traditional LSPs.

#### **5.1. Principles of Persistent Homology**

The primary tool of TDA is **persistent homology**.45 It is a method for computing and summarizing the multiscale topological features of a dataset. In topology, the basic features of a shape are its connected components (0-dimensional "holes"), its loops or tunnels (1-dimensional "holes"), and its voids or cavities (2-dimensional "holes"), and so on.47 Persistent homology tracks how these features appear ("are born") and disappear ("die") as one analyzes the data across a continuum of scales.52  
The process, when applied to a DEM, typically involves a **level-set filtration**. One imagines flooding the landscape from below. As the water level (a scale parameter) rises, islands (peaks) emerge, then merge together, and eventually are submerged. Persistent homology records the water level at which each island is "born" (appears) and the level at which it "dies" (merges with a larger, older island). The "persistence" of a feature is the difference between its death and birth times. The core idea is that features that persist for a long duration of the filtration are considered robust, significant features of the landscape, while those that have a very short lifetime are considered topological "noise".45

* **Outputs (Barcodes and Persistence Diagrams)**: The results of a persistent homology analysis are visualized in one of two equivalent ways:  
  * **Barcode**: Each topological feature is represented by a horizontal bar whose start and end points correspond to its birth and death times, respectively. Long bars represent persistent features.52  
  * **Persistence Diagram**: Each feature is represented as a point (b,d) in a 2D plot, where b is its birth time and d is its death time. Points far from the diagonal line y=x represent persistent features, while points close to the diagonal represent noise.49

This analysis can be applied to the DEM itself (a height function) to study peaks and passes, or to its inverse to study pits and saddles. This allows for a robust, quantitative characterization of the landscape's hierarchical structure.48

#### **5.2. From Topological Signatures to Spatial Covariates**

A significant challenge in applying TDA to spatial statistics is that its primary outputs—barcodes and persistence diagrams—are non-spatial summaries of the entire dataset. They are not raster maps and thus cannot be used directly as covariates in a standard geostatistical model or sampling design.55 To bridge this gap, methods have been developed to transform these topological signatures into spatially explicit features.  
One of the most promising approaches is the **persistence landscape**.55 This technique transforms a persistence diagram into a sequence of functions in a standard vector space. For each point  
(b,d) in the diagram, a tent-like function is created, centered at ((b+d)/2,(d−b)/2). The persistence landscape is the upper envelope of all these tent functions. The result is a surface whose peaks correspond to the most persistent topological features of the original data.55  
To create a spatially explicit covariate from this, one can perform a localized TDA analysis. By applying the persistent homology and landscape transformation workflow within a moving window across the DEM, a summary statistic of the resulting landscape (e.g., its integral, or the height of its highest peak) can be calculated and assigned to the central pixel of the window. The result of this operation is a new raster layer where each pixel's value quantifies the topological complexity of its surrounding neighborhood. For example, a high value in a "pit persistence" raster would indicate a location within a deep, complex basin with many nested depressions, a feature poorly captured by TWI or simple curvature. These TDA-derived covariates thus offer a novel and powerful way to stratify the landscape based on its structural organization, providing information that is fundamentally different from and complementary to traditional LSPs.

## **Part III: A Statistical Framework for Optimized, Covariate-Informed Sampling**

The ultimate goal of defining and deriving the geomorphic covariates discussed in the preceding sections is to leverage this information within a rigorous statistical framework to design a more efficient spatial sampling plan. Efficiency, in this context, is primarily defined by the reduction of estimation variance. This part of the report details the statistical principles that underpin covariate-informed sampling and introduces the advanced methodology of Doubly Balanced Sampling, which provides a synthesis of geographic and feature-space optimization.

### **Section 6\. The Role of Auxiliary Information in Reducing Estimation Variance**

The central objective of many spatial sampling designs is to estimate a property of a population, such as the mean value of a variable of interest over a study area, with the highest possible precision for a given sampling effort. Precision is inversely related to the variance of the estimator; therefore, the goal is to design a sampling configuration that minimizes this variance.56  
Geostatistical theory provides the tools to achieve this. Methods like kriging produce not only an estimate (prediction) at an unsampled location but also an associated estimation (kriging) variance.58 This variance depends on the spatial structure of the variable (captured by the variogram) and the geometry of the sampling points.60 A common objective in sampling design is to find a set of sample locations that minimizes the average kriging variance over the entire study area.57  
This is where auxiliary information, in the form of wall-to-wall covariate layers, becomes invaluable. If a spatially exhaustive covariate (e.g., slope, derived from a DEM) is correlated with the primary variable of interest (e.g., soil organic carbon), it can be used to explain a portion of that variable's spatial variance.61 This principle is the foundation of techniques like regression-kriging, where a regression model is first built between the target variable and the covariates, and then kriging is performed on the model residuals.62 By accounting for the trend captured by the covariates, the remaining (residual) variance that needs to be estimated via kriging is reduced, leading to more precise overall predictions.62  
Therefore, a key principle of efficient sampling is to ensure that the sample is representative not just of the geographic area, but also of the distribution of the important covariates. This is the concept of **covariate space coverage sampling**, where the goal is to select sample points that are well-spread throughout the multi-dimensional space defined by the covariates.65 By capturing the full range of environmental conditions represented by the covariates, the resulting model is more robust and the prediction variance is minimized.

### **Section 7\. Doubly Balanced Sampling: Unifying Geographic and Feature Space**

The most advanced spatial sampling designs seek to optimize efficiency by simultaneously considering two distinct but complementary properties: spatial balance and covariate balance.67

* **Spatial Balance (Spreading)**: This property requires that the sample points are evenly distributed in geographic space, avoiding both clustering of points and the existence of large unsampled gaps.69 Spatial balance is highly efficient when the variable of interest exhibits positive spatial autocorrelation (i.e., nearby locations are more similar than distant locations), which is a near-universal characteristic of environmental and geomorphic variables.69 By spreading the samples out, one maximizes the information gained per sample, as each point provides information about a unique portion of the geographic domain.70  
* **Covariate Balance**: This property requires that the sample distribution of the auxiliary variables closely matches their distribution in the overall population.67 For example, if 20% of the study area has a slope greater than 15 degrees, a balanced sample should also have approximately 20% of its points in that slope class. This ensures that the sample is representative across the feature space, which, as discussed above, is critical for reducing variance when the covariates are correlated with the target variable.73

**Doubly Balanced Sampling (DBS)** refers to a class of modern algorithms explicitly designed to achieve both spatial and covariate balance simultaneously.67 These methods represent the state-of-the-art in survey design for natural resources, as they make the most efficient use of all available auxiliary information—both geographic coordinates and environmental covariates—to minimize the variance of the Horvitz-Thompson estimator, a standard design-based estimator of population totals.68 Two prominent DBS algorithms are the Local Cube method and Balanced Acceptance Sampling.

#### **7.1. The Local Cube Algorithm**

The Local Cube method, developed by Grafström and Tillé, is a sophisticated algorithm that combines the principles of the Cube method for achieving covariate balance with the Local Pivotal Method for achieving spatial balance.68 The Cube method itself is an elegant algorithm that selects a sample satisfying a set of "balancing equations," which state that the Horvitz-Thompson estimates of the covariate totals must equal their known population totals.75 It conceptualizes the sampling process as a random walk within an N-dimensional hypercube (where N is the population size) that is constrained to an affine subspace defined by the balancing equations.75  
The **Local Cube** algorithm modifies this process by incorporating spatial proximity.68 Instead of performing the balancing steps on the entire population at once, it operates iteratively on small clusters of spatially neighboring units.69 At each step, a unit is selected, and its neighbors are identified (e.g., using a k-d tree for efficiency). The flight phase of the Cube method is then applied to this local cluster. This process forces the sampling decisions to be made locally, which has the effect of creating small joint inclusion probabilities for nearby units, thus forcing the final sample to be well-spread in geographic space while still satisfying the overall balancing equations for the covariates.69

#### **7.2. Balanced Acceptance Sampling (BAS)**

Balanced Acceptance Sampling (BAS) is an alternative, conceptually simpler, and computationally efficient method for achieving high levels of spatial balance.71 BAS achieves its spatial spreading property not through iterative updates but by drawing sample locations from a quasi-random, low-discrepancy sequence, most commonly the Halton sequence.71 A low-discrepancy sequence is designed to fill a multi-dimensional space more evenly than a purely random sequence.  
The BAS algorithm generates a long, ordered list of these quasi-random points within the study area's bounding box. To select a sample of size n, the first n points from the sequence that fall within the actual study area boundary are chosen.71 This produces an equal-probability, spatially balanced sample. To accommodate unequal inclusion probabilities (which might be based on covariates), an acceptance/rejection step is added, but the underlying principle of using the Halton sequence to ensure spatial diversity remains.79 Because of its computational speed and conceptual simplicity, BAS is particularly well-suited for generating very large "master samples" from which smaller, spatially balanced subsamples can be drawn for various monitoring purposes, making it a highly flexible tool for large-scale environmental surveys.80 While BAS is primarily a spatially balanced design, it can be used to achieve covariate balance by sampling in the multi-dimensional feature space of the covariates rather than in geographic space.65  
A direct comparison of these state-of-the-art methods is provided in Table 1\.  
**Table 1: Comparison of Doubly Balanced Sampling Algorithms**

| Algorithm | Underlying Principle | Key Strengths | Key Weaknesses | Computational Demand | Recommended Use Case |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Local Cube Method** | Combines the Cube method (for covariate balance) with the Local Pivotal Method (for spatial balance) through iterative, localized balancing steps. | Guarantees strong, often exact, balance on covariates. Highly flexible and statistically rigorous. Directly achieves both balance types simultaneously. 68 | Algorithm is more complex to implement and understand. Can be computationally demanding for very large populations. 68 | Moderate to High. Scales with population size and number of balancing variables. 68 | Projects where strict adherence to balancing equations on a moderate number of covariates is paramount and computational resources are sufficient. |
| **Balanced Acceptance Sampling (BAS)** | Uses a quasi-random (Halton) sequence to generate a spatially well-spread master sample. Unequal probabilities are handled via acceptance/rejection sampling. | Conceptually simple and very fast to execute. Produces excellent spatial balance. Ideal for creating master samples for multi-stage or long-term monitoring. 71 | Primarily a spatially balanced design; achieving strong covariate balance requires sampling in feature space, which may compromise geographic spread. Does not guarantee exact balance on covariates. | Low. Computationally very efficient, even for extremely large populations. 71 | Large-scale environmental surveys, creation of master sample frames, and situations where excellent spatial spread and computational speed are prioritized over exact covariate balance. |

### **Section 8\. A Synthesis of Covariate Selection Strategies**

The effectiveness of any covariate-informed sampling design hinges on the selection of an appropriate and powerful set of auxiliary variables. The challenge lies in identifying a parsimonious set of covariates that captures the maximum amount of variance in the target variable without introducing redundancy or spurious relationships that can degrade model performance and interpretability.82 The approaches to covariate selection can be broadly categorized as data-driven and knowledge-driven, with the most robust strategy involving a hybrid of the two.

* **Data-Driven Approaches**: These methods use statistical algorithms to identify the most predictive covariates from a large pool of candidates based on the available sample data. Common techniques include:  
  * **Stepwise Regression**: Variables are iteratively added to or removed from a model based on a statistical criterion like AIC or BIC.84  
  * **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)**: A model is built with all covariates, and the least important one is iteratively removed until the optimal set is found.82  
  * **Machine Learning Methods**: Algorithms like Random Forests can internally rank the importance of variables, providing a powerful tool for selection in the presence of complex, non-linear relationships.87

    Data-driven methods are powerful for uncovering unexpected relationships but can be "black boxes" and risk overfitting or selecting variables with spurious, non-causal correlations.87  
* **Knowledge-Driven Approaches**: This strategy relies on a priori expert knowledge of the system being studied. In soil science, for example, the SCORPAN model (Soil, Climate, Organisms, Relief, Parent material, Age, space) provides a conceptual framework for selecting relevant environmental covariates.82 This approach ensures that the selected covariates are mechanistically linked to the target variable and have a clear geomorphic or ecological interpretation. Its main limitation is that it may fail to identify important statistical relationships that are not predicted by existing theory.  
* **A Hybrid Strategy for Optimal Selection**: The most defensible and effective strategy is a hybrid approach that integrates both perspectives.83  
  1. **Propose**: Based on geomorphic and process-based knowledge (as detailed in Parts I and II), a comprehensive candidate set of scientifically interpretable covariates is proposed. This ensures that the potential predictors are mechanistically plausible.  
  2. **Refine**: Data-driven methods (e.g., RFE, Random Forest variable importance) are then applied to this candidate set to identify and remove redundant variables (e.g., highly correlated curvatures and roughness metrics) and to confirm the statistical predictive power of the remaining variables.  
  3. **Finalize**: The final set of covariates is one that is both statistically powerful and scientifically defensible, providing a robust basis for the doubly balanced sampling design.

Crucially, this selection process must also consider the multiscale nature of the covariates. Different environmental variables may exert their influence at different spatial scales.36 Therefore, the candidate set should include key variables (like relief or roughness) calculated at multiple scales of analysis. The selection process can then identify the characteristic scale at which each covariate is most strongly related to the target variable, further optimizing the predictive power of the final model.85

## **Part IV: Recommendations and Implementation Workflow**

This final part synthesizes the preceding review into a concrete, actionable framework. It presents a justified suite of covariate and process layers, organized into tiers of increasing complexity, and provides a detailed protocol for their acquisition and generation. This framework is designed to guide the implementation of a state-of-the-art, geomorphology-informed, doubly balanced spatial sampling design.

### **Section 9\. A Justified Suite of Covariate and Process Layers**

The following suite of raster layers is recommended for use as auxiliary information in a DBS design. The layers are organized into three tiers, representing a hierarchy from foundational to advanced. This tiered structure allows for flexibility in implementation based on project goals, data availability, and computational resources.

#### **Tier 1: Foundational Balancing Covariates**

These layers capture the first-order, multiscale structure of the topography and are considered essential for any robust sampling design aimed at characterizing geomorphic or ecological variables. They serve as the primary **balancing covariates**.

* **Digital Elevation Model (DEM)**: The master variable from which all other topographic covariates are derived. It directly represents elevation, a primary control on numerous environmental gradients (e.g., temperature, precipitation).  
* **Slope Gradient**: The most fundamental proxy for gravitational potential energy. It stratifies the landscape by its capacity for erosion, transport, and deposition.  
* **Multiscale Topographic Roughness (from Wavelets)**: This metric should be used as a robust replacement for standard curvature measures. It quantifies surface texture and complexity. It is recommended to generate this layer at multiple characteristic scales (e.g., a fine scale of 3x3 pixels, an intermediate scale of 9x9 pixels, and a broad scale of 27x27 pixels) to capture different scales of landscape dissection.  
  * **Justification**: This approach directly addresses the "curvature crisis" by providing a stable, reproducible, and interpretable measure of topographic form that is less susceptible to the software-specific ambiguities of standard curvature calculations.15 It provides a powerful, scale-explicit characterization of landscape complexity, from local hillslope texture to broader landform patterns.39  
* **Multiscale Local Relief**: Calculated as the elevation range within multiple moving window sizes. This captures the magnitude of vertical dissection at different spatial scales, reflecting the influence of different geomorphic processes operating over different extents.

#### **Tier 2: Process-Based Metrics**

These layers are compound indices that serve as proxies for specific hydrological and geomorphic processes. They are powerful for stratifying the landscape into distinct process domains.

* **Topographic Wetness Index (TWI)**: A proxy for the spatial distribution of steady-state soil moisture.  
  * **Justification**: TWI is essential for stratifying the landscape by its hydrological regime, which is a primary control on soil development, vegetation distribution, and biogeochemical cycling.22 Its use must be accompanied by an explicit acknowledgment of its underlying assumptions (e.g., slope-parallel shallow flow) and its sensitivity to DEM pre-processing.23  
* **Stream Power Index (SPI)**: A proxy for the erosive power of concentrated fluvial flow.  
  * **Justification**: SPI directly identifies zones of high geomorphic activity within the fluvial system. It is a critical covariate for any study related to soil erosion, sediment transport, channel dynamics, or the distribution of riparian ecosystems.29

#### **Tier 3: Advanced & Exploratory Covariates**

These novel layers are derived from advanced computational methods and are designed to capture complex aspects of landscape organization and structure that are missed by traditional metrics.

* **Persistence Landscape of Topographic Pits/Depressions**: A raster layer where each cell's value represents a summary statistic (e.g., the integral or maximum value) of the persistence landscape computed from a local neighborhood. This quantifies the significance and complexity of depressions.  
  * **Justification**: This TDA-derived covariate provides a unique measure of potential surface water storage and complex hydrological connectivity (e.g., in karst, glacial, or thermokarst landscapes) that is not captured by TWI, which assumes continuous downslope flow.48 It quantifies the  
    *arrangement* and *nestedness* of depressions, not just their local depth.  
* **Persistence Landscape of Ridges/Divides**: A raster derived from applying the same TDA workflow to the inverted DEM, quantifying the significance of the local drainage divide network.  
  * **Justification**: This metric quantifies the degree of landscape dissection and the connectivity of the ridge network in a novel manner. It can be highly relevant for modeling phenomena controlled by dispersal pathways, such as seed dispersal, animal movement, or the spread of wildfire.51

Table 2 provides a summary of this recommended suite of layers, outlining their role and justification.  
**Table 2: Recommended Covariate and Process Layers for a Geomorphology-Informed DBS Design**

| Layer Name | Tier | Data Source / Derivation | Primary Role | Detailed Justification for Inclusion |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Digital Elevation Model (DEM)** | 1 | Lidar, IfSAR, or Photogrammetry (e.g., 3DEP, Copernicus) | Balancing | The foundational dataset representing the primary control of elevation on environmental gradients. |
| **Slope Gradient** | 1 | First derivative of DEM | Balancing | A primary proxy for gravitational potential energy, stratifying the landscape by its capacity for erosion and transport. 17 |
| **Wavelet Roughness (at multiple scales)** | 1 | Wavelet transform of DEM | Balancing | A robust, multiscale measure of topographic texture and complexity; avoids the ambiguities of standard curvature metrics. 39 |
| **Local Relief (at multiple scales)** | 1 | Elevation range in moving window on DEM | Balancing | Quantifies the magnitude of vertical dissection at multiple scales, reflecting different stages of landscape evolution. 4 |
| **Topographic Wetness Index (TWI)** | 2 | Derived from DEM (contributing area and slope) | Process Proxy | Proxy for topographically controlled soil moisture, stratifying the landscape by hydrological regime. 14 |
| **Stream Power Index (SPI)** | 2 | Derived from DEM (contributing area and slope) | Process Proxy | Proxy for fluvial erosive power, identifying zones of high geomorphic activity and potential erosion. 29 |
| **Persistence Landscape of Depressions** | 3 | TDA (persistent homology) on local DEM neighborhoods | Balancing | A novel metric quantifying the structural complexity and storage potential of topographic depressions, capturing features missed by TWI. 48 |
| **Persistence Landscape of Ridges** | 3 | TDA (persistent homology) on inverted local DEM neighborhoods | Balancing | A novel metric quantifying the connectivity and organization of the drainage divide network, relevant for dispersal and connectivity modeling. 51 |

### **Section 10\. Data Acquisition and Generation Protocol**

The following protocol outlines the recommended workflow for acquiring and generating the covariate layers defined in Section 9\. Adherence to a consistent and well-documented workflow is critical for ensuring the reproducibility and scientific integrity of the subsequent sampling design and analysis.

#### **Recommended DEM Source**

* **For the conterminous United States**: The USGS 3D Elevation Program (3DEP) seamless DEMs are the recommended source. The 1/3 arc-second (\~10m) product provides an excellent balance of resolution and manageable data volume for regional-scale studies. For fine-scale studies, the 1-meter product should be used where available.8 Data can be accessed via  
  *The National Map* downloader.11  
* **For global or non-US applications**: The Copernicus DEM (GLO-30 or GLO-90) is recommended due to its high vertical accuracy and global consistency, which has been shown to be superior to many other global datasets.4 Data can be accessed via the appropriate distribution portals.

#### **Pre-processing and Covariate Generation Workflow**

1. **DEM Acquisition and Preparation**:  
   * Download the required DEM tiles to cover the full extent of the study area.  
   * Mosaic the tiles into a single, seamless raster dataset in a suitable projected coordinate system (e.g., UTM) to ensure accurate distance and area calculations.  
   * Perform **Hydrological Conditioning**. This is a critical step for the accurate calculation of TWI and SPI. It involves removing spurious pits or sinks in the DEM that impede flow routing algorithms. Standard "fill" algorithms should be used, but with caution in landscapes with significant natural closed depressions (e.g., karst), where more sophisticated breaching or hybrid methods may be required to preserve natural hydrology.1  
2. **Covariate Derivation**:  
   * **Tier 1 & 2 Covariates**: Use a single, consistent GIS or geoprocessing environment to derive the standard LSPs. Open-source platforms like SAGA GIS or WhiteboxTools are highly recommended as they offer a wide range of advanced and well-documented geomorphometric algorithms. This consistency is vital to avoid the software-specific inconsistencies identified in the "curvature crisis." Calculate Slope, Local Relief (at multiple window sizes), TWI, and SPI from the hydrologically conditioned DEM.  
   * **Tier 1 & 3 Advanced Covariates**: The generation of wavelet-based and TDA-based covariates requires specialized computational libraries. This will typically be performed in a scripting environment like Python or R.  
     * For **Wavelet Roughness**, use a library such as PyWavelets in Python to perform a 2D discrete wavelet transform on the DEM. The energy or standard deviation of the detail coefficients at each decomposition level can then be calculated within a moving window to produce the final roughness rasters.39  
     * For **TDA Persistence Landscapes**, use a specialized TDA library such as GUDHI or Dionysus in Python. The workflow involves iterating through the DEM with a moving window, extracting the elevation values within the window as a point cloud or height map, computing the persistent homology (of sublevel or superlevel sets), generating the persistence landscape, and calculating a summary statistic to assign to the central pixel.55 This is a computationally intensive process that may require parallel processing for large areas.  
3. **Finalization and Standardization**:  
   * Ensure all generated covariate layers are co-registered to the exact same grid (i.e., same extent, cell size, and alignment).  
   * **Standardize** all final covariate layers. This is a mandatory step before inputting them into a DBS algorithm that uses a distance metric in feature space (like the Local Cube method or feature-space BAS).65 Each raster should be transformed to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1\. This prevents variables with larger numerical ranges (like elevation) from dominating the distance calculations over variables with smaller ranges (like slope or TWI).

By following this comprehensive protocol, a rich, multiscale, and geomorphologically meaningful set of covariates can be developed. This suite of auxiliary information, when integrated into a Doubly Balanced Sampling framework, will provide the statistical foundation for a highly efficient and powerful spatial sampling design, capable of capturing the complex spatial variability of environmental properties with minimal variance and maximal scientific insight.
