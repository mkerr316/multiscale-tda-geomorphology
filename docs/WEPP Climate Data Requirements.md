# **A Comprehensive Guide to Climate Data Requirements for the Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) Model**

## **Introduction**

The Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model represents a significant advancement in soil erosion science, providing a process-based, distributed parameter, and continuous simulation framework for predicting runoff, soil loss, and sediment yield.1 Developed by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and other federal agencies, WEPP is built upon fundamental principles of hydrology, soil physics, plant science, and erosion mechanics.3 Its utility in conservation planning, environmental assessment, and research is fundamentally dependent on the quality, resolution, and temporal scale of its inputs, among which climate data is the primary driver of the entire simulated system.5  
A frequent and critical question among both new and experienced users of the WEPP model concerns the necessary amount of climate data required for a valid analysis. This query, while seemingly straightforward, encompasses two distinct and often conflated concepts that are central to the correct application of the model. The first concept is the **historical record length**, which refers to the number of years of observed weather data needed to properly parameterize WEPP's integrated stochastic weather generator, CLIGEN. The second is the **simulation length**, which is the number of years for which the WEPP model itself is run to generate predictions and statistical outputs.  
Understanding the distinction between these two temporal scales is not a mere technicality; it is the cornerstone of a methodologically sound WEPP analysis. The length of the historical record determines the statistical reliability of the climate "recipe" used by the model, ensuring it is representative of a location's long-term weather patterns. In contrast, the simulation length determines the statistical robustness of the model's predictions, ensuring a sufficient sample of synthetic years is generated to capture everything from average conditions to rare, high-magnitude events. This report provides an exhaustive, expert-level examination of both of these requirements. It will detail the specific climate variables that drive WEPP's physical processes, explore the different methods for sourcing climate inputs, establish the scientific basis for recommended historical record lengths, and connect the user's specific analytical objectives to the appropriate simulation length. The goal is to equip conservation planners, environmental consultants, and researchers with a nuanced and defensible understanding of how to properly supply climate data to one of the world's most advanced water erosion prediction tools.

## **Section 1: The Climate Engine of WEPP: A Process-Based Perspective**

To comprehend the climate data requirements of the WEPP model, one must first appreciate its architecture as a continuous, process-based system. Unlike empirical models that rely on statistical relationships, WEPP simulates the physical processes governing erosion on a daily time step.5 This continuous simulation approach means that the model "mimics" the state of the soil, plant, and water system each day, with the conditions on any given day being a direct consequence of the cumulative weather effects of all preceding days.4 This architecture necessitates a continuous, detailed sequence of daily climate inputs to drive its interconnected sub-models.

### **1.1 Daily Climate Variables as Primary Model Drivers**

The WEPP model requires a specific set of daily meteorological variables to execute its calculations. These inputs are not optional; they are the fundamental energy and water inputs that propel the entire simulated ecosystem.7 The core daily variables required for a WEPP simulation are:

* **Precipitation Amount:** The total depth of precipitation for the day.7  
* **Precipitation Storm Characteristics:** For each storm event within a day, WEPP requires its duration, the time to peak rainfall intensity, and the ratio of the peak intensity to the average intensity. These sub-daily details are critical for simulating the physics of runoff and erosion.7  
* **Maximum and Minimum Air Temperature:** The highest and lowest air temperatures recorded during the 24-hour period.7  
* **Solar Radiation:** The total amount of solar energy received at the surface over the course of the day.7  
* **Wind Speed and Direction:** The average wind velocity and prevailing direction for the day.7  
* **Dew Point Temperature:** The temperature to which air must be cooled to become saturated with water vapor, used in evapotranspiration calculations.9

The necessity for this detailed, multi-variable daily input stands in stark contrast to simpler models that may only require an annual rainfall erosivity factor. WEPP's process-based nature demands a process-based understanding of the daily weather that drives the system.

### **1.2 Mapping Climate Inputs to WEPP's Physical Process Sub-Models**

Each climate variable serves as a direct input to one or more of WEPP's seven core sub-models, creating a complex web of interactions that simulates the real-world environment.10 The credibility of the final erosion prediction rests on how accurately these inputs drive each component process.

* **Hydrology Component:** This is the primary component driven by precipitation. The amount, duration, and intensity of rainfall directly control the calculations for infiltration, which WEPP models using a modified Green-Ampt equation.1 When rainfall intensity exceeds the infiltration capacity of the soil, surface runoff is generated. The volume and peak rate of this runoff are calculated using solutions to the kinematic wave equations.1 This runoff is the transport mechanism for eroded sediment and the primary source of energy for detachment in rills.  
* **Plant Growth and Residue Decomposition Component:** The state of vegetation is a critical control on erosion, and its simulation is highly dependent on climate. Daily temperature (specifically, growing degree days), solar radiation, and soil moisture (a function of precipitation and evapotranspiration) govern the rate of plant growth, the development of canopy cover, the accumulation of above- and below-ground biomass, and the timing of senescence.4 Simultaneously, temperature and moisture control the rate at which dead plant residue on the soil surface decomposes. The resulting canopy and ground cover directly affect erosion by intercepting raindrops, reducing the kinetic energy that reaches the soil surface, and by slowing the velocity of overland flow.7  
* **Erosion Component:** WEPP's erosion calculations are a direct function of the outputs from the hydrology component. The model partitions erosion into two primary processes: interrill and rill erosion.7 Interrill erosion, the detachment of soil particles by raindrop impact on areas between rills, is calculated as a function of effective rainfall intensity and the shallow runoff rate.7 Rill erosion, which occurs in small, concentrated flow channels, is driven by the hydraulic shear stress exerted by the flowing water. This shear stress is a function of the runoff rate and slope, meaning that more intense storms that generate higher peak runoff rates will have a disproportionately larger capacity to cause rill erosion.6  
* **Water Balance Component:** WEPP maintains a continuous, daily water balance for the soil profile. This is essentially a daily accounting system that tracks inputs (precipitation, irrigation) and outputs (infiltration, runoff, plant transpiration, soil evaporation, deep percolation).1 Evapotranspiration, a major output, is calculated using either the Penman or Priestley-Taylor equation, which requires inputs of temperature, solar radiation, and wind.10 The result of this daily balance is the antecedent soil moisture condition for the following day. This is a crucial feedback mechanism, as a soil that is already wet from previous rains will generate runoff more quickly and in greater volumes than a dry soil, profoundly affecting the erosive potential of a given storm.16

The interconnectedness of these components, all driven by the daily climate sequence, illustrates why a continuous and detailed climate record is essential. The model's ability to simulate the state of the system today depends entirely on the weather that occurred yesterday, last week, and last month. This continuous "memory" of antecedent conditions is a primary advantage of WEPP over single-event models, which must make simplifying assumptions about the state of the system before a storm begins.16 Furthermore, the model's sensitivity to sub-daily storm characteristics like peak intensity means that the internal structure of a storm is just as important as the total daily rainfall amount, a level of physical realism that demands higher-resolution climate inputs.7

| Table 1: WEPP Climate Input Parameters and Their Functions |  |  |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Parameter** | **WEPP Sub-Model(s) Affected** | **Role/Function** |
| Daily Precipitation (Amount, Duration, Peak Intensity, Time to Peak) | Hydrology, Erosion, Water Balance, Plant Growth | Primary source of water for the system. Drives infiltration and runoff calculations. Kinetic energy from raindrops detaches soil particles (interrill erosion). Runoff provides the energy for concentrated flow erosion (rill erosion). Replenishes soil moisture for plant growth. 1 |
| Maximum & Minimum Daily Temperature | Plant Growth, Residue Decomposition, Winter Hydrology, Water Balance | Governs plant growth rates (growing degree days). Controls the rate of microbial decomposition of surface residue. Determines whether precipitation falls as rain or snow and drives snowmelt processes. Influences evapotranspiration rates. 7 |
| Daily Solar Radiation | Plant Growth, Water Balance | Provides the energy for photosynthesis, driving biomass accumulation. A key input for calculating potential evapotranspiration, which affects the daily water balance and antecedent soil moisture. 7 |
| Daily Wind Speed & Direction | Water Balance, Erosion (indirectly) | Required for the Penman equation to calculate evapotranspiration. Affects snow distribution patterns (though WEPP's primary focus is water erosion). 7 |
| Dew Point Temperature | Water Balance | Used in conjunction with air temperature and solar radiation to provide a more accurate estimate of evapotranspiration and the overall energy balance of the system. 9 |

## **Section 2: Sourcing Climate Inputs: Observed Records vs. Stochastic Generation**

Having established the critical role of daily climate data, the next step is to understand the two primary methods for generating the required climate input files (.cli) for a WEPP simulation. The choice between these methods is not arbitrary; it is fundamentally dictated by the user's analytical objective. The core question to be answered determines the appropriate data source: are you analyzing what *did* happen in the past, or are you predicting what *could* statistically happen in the future?

### **2.1 The Direct Approach: Using Observed Historical Data**

The most direct way to provide climate data to WEPP is to use an observed historical record for a specific storm or period. This involves creating a climate file that contains the actual measured weather data for each day of the desired analysis period.14 For high-fidelity storm simulations, this often requires "breakpoint" precipitation data, which consists of a series of time stamps and corresponding cumulative precipitation amounts, capturing the internal intensity variations of the storm.9  
**Primary Use Cases:**

* **Model Calibration and Validation:** This is the most critical application of observed data. To assess how well the WEPP model performs at a specific location, its predictions are compared against measured field data (e.g., from runoff plots) for known historical storm events. This requires running the model with the exact climate data that occurred during those events. This process is essential for building confidence in the model's predictions for a given region or set of conditions.13  
* **Forensic Analysis of Past Events:** Researchers and land managers may use WEPP to understand the drivers of a specific, significant past erosion event, such as a post-wildfire debris flow. Running the model with the observed climate data for that event allows for a detailed reconstruction of the hydrologic and erosional processes that occurred.  
* **Continuous Historical Simulation:** With the advent of high-resolution, spatially explicit meteorological datasets (e.g., radar-derived precipitation, gridded temperature products like PRISM), it has become feasible to run WEPP continuously using observed data for multi-year historical periods.9 The Daily Erosion Project (DEP), for instance, uses this approach to provide near real-time daily estimates of runoff and soil loss across the U.S. Midwest by feeding the model with observed radar precipitation data.9

The primary advantage of using observed data is that it represents reality for a specific time and place. However, its limitation is that a historical record, particularly a short one, may not be representative of the long-term climate, and the required high-resolution data can be difficult to obtain for many locations.23

### **2.2 The Predictive Approach: The CLIGEN Stochastic Weather Generator**

For most planning and assessment applications, the goal is not to replicate a specific past event but to estimate long-term average erosion rates and the likelihood of future extreme events. For this purpose, WEPP is almost always used in conjunction with its built-in stochastic weather generator, CLIGEN (CLImate GENerator).2  
CLIGEN is not a weather forecasting model; it does not predict the weather for a specific future day. Instead, it is a statistical tool that uses a set of monthly climate parameters—such as means, standard deviations, and probabilities derived from a long-term historical record—to generate a synthetic, statistically representative sequence of daily weather for any desired number of years.10 For each generated day with precipitation, CLIGEN also stochastically generates the required storm characteristics (duration, peak intensity, etc.).25  
**Primary Use Cases:**

* **Long-Term Average Prediction:** This is the most common use of WEPP for conservation planning. By running the model with a long (e.g., 30- to 100-year) CLIGEN-generated climate sequence, users can calculate the average annual runoff and soil loss for a given management scenario. This long-term average smooths out the effects of individual wet or dry years and provides a stable estimate for comparing the effectiveness of different conservation practices.4  
* **Risk and Probability Analysis:** A key strength of the WEPP-CLIGEN combination is its ability to perform risk-based assessments. By generating a very long simulation (e.g., 100 years or more), users can analyze the full distribution of annual erosion outcomes. This allows for the calculation of exceedance probabilities and the estimation of return periods for events of a specific magnitude (e.g., the 2-year, 10-year, or 50-year erosion event). This information is far more valuable for designing resilient systems (e.g., culverts, sediment basins) than a simple average.10  
* **Climate Change Impact Assessment:** CLIGEN's statistical foundation makes it a powerful tool for exploring the potential impacts of future climate change. Researchers can systematically alter the monthly parameters in the CLIGEN input file to reflect projections from Global Climate Models (GCMs)—for example, by increasing mean monthly precipitation or the number of wet days—and then generate new, future-climate weather sequences to drive WEPP. This allows for a quantitative assessment of how erosion rates might respond to a changing climate.11

The choice between these two methods hinges on the fundamental question being asked. If the question is retrospective ("What were the erosion rates during the 2018 season?"), observed data is the appropriate tool. If the question is prospective or statistical ("What is the long-term average erosion rate under no-till management?" or "What is the probability of exceeding 10 tons per hectare of soil loss in any given year?"), then the CLIGEN-driven approach is required. The rise of high-quality gridded datasets is beginning to enable long-term retrospective analyses that were previously impractical, but for future-oriented planning and risk assessment, stochastic generation remains the indispensable standard.

| Table 2: Comparison of Climate Input Methodologies |  |  |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Feature** | **Direct Observed Data (Breakpoint File)** | **CLIGEN Generated Data** |
| **Primary Question** | "What *did* happen during a specific past event or period?" | "What *could* statistically happen over the long term?" |
| **Typical Use Case** | Model Calibration & Validation; Forensic Analysis of Past Events; Near Real-Time Daily Estimation 9 | Long-Term Conservation Planning; Risk & Return Period Analysis; Climate Change Impact Assessment 5 |
| **Data Requirements** | Detailed, high-resolution (often sub-hourly) observed data for a specific historical period. 9 | A single statistical parameter (.par) file derived from a long-term historical record. 25 |
| **Key Advantage** | Represents actual historical conditions with high fidelity for a specific period. | Can generate statistically representative climate for any number of years, enabling robust long-term and probabilistic analysis. |
| **Key Limitation** | The specific historical period may not be representative of long-term climate variability. High-resolution data can be difficult to acquire. 23 | The generated sequence is a statistical representation, not a forecast; it will not match any specific historical year. |

## **Section 3: Parameterizing the Weather Generator: The Importance of Historical Record Length**

This section directly addresses the first critical component of the user's query: for a predictive analysis using the CLIGEN weather generator, how many years of historical climate data are needed to create a reliable input parameter file? The answer to this question is crucial, as the quality of the entire long-term simulation depends on the statistical integrity of these input parameters.

### **3.1 From Daily Observations to Monthly Statistics**

The process of creating a CLIGEN parameter (.par) file begins with a long-term historical record of daily weather data from a specific meteorological station.30 This raw daily data is analyzed to compute a set of monthly statistical parameters that characterize the climate at that location. These parameters, which form the contents of the .par file, include, for each month of the year:

* Mean, standard deviation, and skew coefficient of precipitation amount on a wet day.11  
* The probability of a wet day following a dry day, and the probability of a wet day following a wet day (these are first-order Markov chain parameters that govern precipitation occurrence).11  
* Mean and standard deviation of daily maximum air temperature.11  
* Mean and standard deviation of daily minimum air temperature.11  
* Mean and standard deviation of daily solar radiation.11  
* Mean daily dew point temperature.30  
* Other parameters related to storm intensity and wind.30

This .par file serves as the complete recipe for the climate at a given site. CLIGEN reads these monthly statistics and uses them in conjunction with random number generators to produce a synthetic daily weather sequence that, over a long simulation, will reproduce the statistical characteristics of the original historical record.17 The length and quality of that original historical record are therefore paramount to ensuring the generated weather is a faithful representation of the site's climate.

### **3.2 Standards and Best Practices for Historical Record Length**

The selection of an appropriate historical record length is a matter of achieving statistical stability and representativeness. A record that is too short may be biased by short-term climate anomalies (like a multi-year drought) and will not capture the full range of variability, leading to unreliable monthly parameters and, consequently, flawed WEPP predictions.

* **The Problem of Inconsistent Records:** The original U.S. CLIGEN database, released with WEPP in 1995, was a landmark achievement but suffered from a significant methodological issue. The parameter files for its 2,642 stations were derived from historical records of widely varying lengths, ranging from as few as 9 years to as many as 117 years, with most records ending around 1992\.19 This inconsistency created a critical problem: two nearby weather stations could have substantially different climate statistics—and thus produce very different WEPP erosion predictions—simply because their parameters were calculated from different periods of history (e.g., one from 1920-1992 and another from 1970-1992). This lack of spatial and temporal consistency was identified as a major source of uncertainty and a barrier to user confidence in the model's predictions.19  
* **The U.S. Gold Standard: A Consistent 40-Year Record:** To rectify this issue and incorporate more recent climate data, the entire U.S. CLIGEN database was systematically updated. The new database, often referred to as the 2015 database, was created using a consistent and standardized **40-year period of record from 1974 to 2013** for all 2,765 stations.18 This standardization ensures that the climate statistics are temporally consistent across the entire country, making comparisons between sites far more reliable and improving the spatial consistency of WEPP predictions.19 For any WEPP analysis conducted within the United States, using a CLIGEN parameter file from this updated 40-year database is considered the current gold standard and best practice.  
* **International and Data-Scarce Standards:** Globally, obtaining a consistent 40-year record for every location is not always feasible. Recognizing this, international CLIGEN parameter datasets have been developed using a tiered approach based on minimum record lengths. While a longer record is always preferable, these datasets provide validated parameters for locations with:  
  * **30-year minimum record lengths**  
  * **20-year minimum record lengths**  
  * **10-year minimum record lengths** 35

Validation studies comparing these tiers have shown that while discrepancy increases slightly with shorter record lengths, the effect is relatively small, suggesting that even a 10-year record can provide usable, if less robust, parameters.37

* **Absolute Minimum Recommendation:** Based on the available standards and the underlying statistical theory, a historical record of **25 to 30 years** should be considered the practical minimum for developing a new CLIGEN parameter file.30 Records shorter than this are highly susceptible to statistical instability and may not adequately represent the long-term climatic variability required for a credible erosion risk assessment.

It is essential to grasp that the length of this historical record is solely for the purpose of calculating a stable set of statistical parameters. A 40-year historical record is not used to run a 40-year WEPP simulation. Rather, it is used to generate a single .par file, which can then be used by CLIGEN to generate a synthetic climate sequence of *any* desired length—be it 30 years, 100 years, or even 500 years.33 The historical record length ensures the quality of the recipe; the simulation length determines how much weather is cooked with it. Furthermore, the standardization to the 1974-2013 period is not just a matter of consistency; it also implicitly captures recent, documented climate trends, such as increases in annual precipitation and temperatures across much of the U.S..19 Using this updated database is therefore critical for producing erosion predictions that are relevant to the current climate regime.

## **Section 4: Defining the Analytical Horizon: Selecting the Appropriate Simulation Length**

The second part of the user's query—how many days or years a WEPP simulation needs to run—can now be addressed. Unlike the historical record length, which has a clear best practice, the simulation length is entirely dependent on the analytical objective. The duration of the simulation is a form of statistical sampling strategy; the user must run the model long enough to generate a sufficient sample of synthetic years to reliably answer their specific question.

### **4.1 Single-Storm Event Analysis**

For analyses focused on a single, discrete storm event, the concept of a multi-year simulation is not applicable. In this mode, WEPP is configured to run for a single day or for the duration of the storm being studied.4 The climate input file contains the detailed meteorological data for only that specific event, often using breakpoint rainfall data to capture the storm's hydrograph.15 This approach is used for model calibration, validation against field plot data, or forensic analysis of a past event, where the goal is to replicate a specific, known outcome.39

### **4.2 Continuous Simulation for Stable Averages**

The most common objective in conservation planning is to estimate the long-term average annual soil loss for a particular hillslope under a specific management system (e.g., conventional tillage vs. no-till). Erosion is an episodic process, often dominated by a small number of large rainfall events that may occur infrequently.4 A short simulation of only 5 or 10 years is statistically inadequate because it could, by chance, fall within an unusually dry period and thus drastically underestimate the true long-term average, or conversely, include one or two very large storms that would skew the average high.  
To obtain a stable and representative average, the simulation must be run long enough to smooth out this year-to-year variability and capture a representative sample of different storm types and antecedent conditions. Based on extensive model application and expert guidance, the following recommendations apply:

* For **temperate climates** with relatively consistent annual precipitation (generally defined as greater than 500 mm/year), a simulation length of **30 years** is typically sufficient to achieve a stable estimate of the average annual erosion.41  
* For **arid, semi-arid, or highly variable climates**, where erosion-causing runoff events are rare and sporadic, a longer simulation is required to ensure that a sufficient number of significant wet years are included in the sample. In these environments, a simulation length of **50 years or more** is recommended to obtain a reliable average.41

### **4.3 Probabilistic Analysis and Risk Assessment**

For many applications, particularly those involving infrastructure design or the assessment of high-consequence hazards (e.g., post-wildfire erosion), the average annual soil loss is an insufficient and potentially misleading metric. Two sites could have the same 30-year average erosion, but one may experience it as a low level of chronic erosion each year, while the other experiences 29 years of near-zero erosion followed by one catastrophic event. To distinguish between these scenarios and quantify the risk of extreme events, a probabilistic analysis is necessary.10  
This is achieved by running WEPP for a very long continuous simulation. The model outputs the total soil loss for each individual year in the simulation. This list of annual values is then sorted by magnitude, from smallest to largest. From this sorted distribution, one can directly estimate return periods.26 For example:

* In a 100-year simulation, the single largest annual soil loss value is the estimate of the 100-year return period event (i.e., an event with a 1% probability of being equaled or exceeded in any given year).  
* The second-largest value is the estimate of the 50-year return period event.  
* The fifth-largest value is the estimate of the 20-year return period event, and so on.27

To conduct this type of robust statistical analysis, a **100-year simulation is the widely accepted standard**.10 Some WEPP interfaces allow for simulations of up to 200 years to provide even greater statistical depth for analyzing very rare events.42 A 100-year run provides a large enough sample of synthetic years to reliably estimate the full spectrum of return periods relevant to most conservation and engineering applications.

| Table 3: Simulation Length and Associated Return Period Estimates |  |  |  |  |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Order of Magnitude of Annual Event** | **10-Year Simulation** | **20-Year Simulation** | **50-Year Simulation** | **100-Year Simulation** |
| **Greatest** | 10-year return | 20-year return | 50-year return | 100-year return |
| **Second** | 5-year return | 10-year return | 25-year return | 50-year return |
| **Fifth** | 2-year return | 5-year return | 10-year return | 20-year return |
| **Tenth** | \-- | 2-year return | 5-year return | 10-year return |
| **Twentieth** | \-- | \-- | 2.5-year return | 5-year return |
| **Middle (Average)** | 2-year return | 2-year return | 2-year return | 2-year return |
| Source: Adapted from Disturbed WEPP Documentation 27 |  |  |  |  |

This table powerfully illustrates the relationship between simulation length and analytical capability. A user who runs only a 20-year simulation cannot make any claims about the magnitude of a 50- or 100-year erosion event at their site. The simulation length must be chosen to match the desired statistical output.

## **Section 5: Synthesis and Practical Recommendations**

The preceding sections have established the scientific and methodological foundations for determining the appropriate climate data requirements for the WEPP model. This final section synthesizes this information into a clear, actionable decision framework to guide users in making sound choices for their specific applications. The central principle is that the analytical objective dictates all subsequent decisions regarding data sourcing, historical record length, and simulation duration.

### **5.1 The Crucial Distinction: A Final Clarification**

To ensure a defensible WEPP analysis, it is imperative to maintain a clear understanding of the two distinct temporal scales discussed throughout this report:

* **Historical Record Length:** This refers to the period of observed weather data (e.g., 40 years for the U.S. standard) used to calculate the monthly statistical parameters for the CLIGEN weather generator. Its purpose is to ensure the statistical **quality and representativeness** of the climate model's inputs. A long, consistent record builds a reliable "recipe" for the weather at a site.  
* **Simulation Length:** This refers to the number of years for which the WEPP model is run using the climate generated by CLIGEN (e.g., 30, 50, or 100 years). Its purpose is to ensure the statistical **robustness** of the model's predictive output. A long simulation generates a large enough sample of synthetic years to reliably calculate averages and analyze the probability of extreme events.

These two values are independent. A 40-year historical record is used to parameterize CLIGEN, which is then used to generate a 100-year simulation to drive WEPP. Conflating these two concepts is a common source of methodological error.

### **5.2 Key Considerations for Ensuring a Defensible Analysis**

Beyond selecting the correct time scales, several overarching principles should guide any WEPP modeling effort:

1. **Use the Most Current and Consistent Database:** Always use the most up-to-date and temporally consistent CLIGEN parameter database available. For the United States, this means using the 2015 database (based on the 1974-2013 record) over the outdated 1995 version. This practice accounts for recent climate trends and ensures that predictions are spatially consistent and comparable between different locations.19  
2. **Acknowledge Climate Sensitivity:** Numerous studies have shown that WEPP's outputs are highly sensitive to its climate inputs, particularly precipitation characteristics and infiltration parameters.6 This sensitivity underscores the importance of careful climate data selection and parameterization. The credibility of the final erosion estimate is more dependent on the quality of the climate data than on almost any other input.  
3. **Document Methodological Choices:** As with any scientific model, transparency is key. The final report or analysis should clearly document all climate-related choices: the source and version of the CLIGEN parameter file, the historical period of record used for its parameterization, and the length of the WEPP simulation. This documentation is fundamental to the reproducibility and defensibility of the results.

### **5.3 Decision Matrix for WEPP Climate Data Selection**

To provide a final, consolidated guide, the following decision matrix connects common analytical objectives with the appropriate data types and temporal scales. This matrix serves as a practical checklist to ensure that the WEPP model is applied correctly and that the results are fit for their intended purpose.

| Table 4: Decision Matrix for WEPP Climate Data Selection |  |  |  |  |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Analytical Objective** | **Recommended Data Type** | **Minimum Historical Record Length (for CLIGEN)** | **Recommended Simulation Length** | **Primary Output** |
| **Model Calibration / Validation for a Specific Storm** | Observed Breakpoint Data | Not Applicable | Single Event / Day | Comparison of predicted vs. measured runoff and soil loss for one storm. 13 |
| **Estimating Average Annual Erosion (Temperate Climate)** | CLIGEN Generated | 40 years (U.S. Standard); 30 years (International) 23 | 30 years | Stable, long-term average annual runoff and soil loss. 41 |
| **Estimating Average Annual Erosion (Arid / Semi-Arid Climate)** | CLIGEN Generated | 40 years (U.S. Standard); 30 years (International) 23 | 50+ years | Stable, long-term average annual runoff and soil loss that captures infrequent wet cycles. 41 |
| **Probabilistic Risk Assessment / Return Period Analysis** | CLIGEN Generated | 40 years (U.S. Standard); 30 years (International) 23 | 100+ years | Exceedance probabilities and estimates of 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100-year return period events. 10 |
| **Climate Change Impact Assessment** | CLIGEN Generated (with modified parameters) | 40 years (U.S. Standard); 30 years (International) 23 | 30 to 100 years (depending on whether analyzing change in average or change in extremes) | Comparison of runoff and soil loss under current vs. future climate scenarios. 11 |

By aligning the analytical goal with the corresponding methodology in this matrix, users can confidently and correctly apply the WEPP model, leveraging its full power as a predictive tool for soil and water conservation.
