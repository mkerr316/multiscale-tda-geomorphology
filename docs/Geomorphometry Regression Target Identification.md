## **Part I: Theoretical Foundations: The Geomorphic Control on Earth Surface Processes**

The premise of predicting a fundamental environmental state variable from parameters describing land-surface shape is grounded in the first principles of geomorphology, hydrology, and climatology. Topography is not merely a passive surface; it is the primary template that modulates the fluxes of mass and energy across the Earth's terrestrial domain. The multiscale geometric and topological features of the landscape, which Topological Land-Surface Parameters (TLSPs) are designed to capture, directly govern the physical processes that determine the spatial distribution of water, the patterns of energy input, and the resulting state of the critical zone. This section establishes the theoretical cascade that links landscape form to the candidate regression targets.

### **1.1 Topography as the Primary Modulator of Mass and Energy Fluxes**

At any point on the landscape, the local and non-local topography dictates the convergence and divergence of water and the intensity of incoming solar radiation—the two principal drivers of near-surface Earth system processes.1

#### **Water Flux**

The movement of water across and through the shallow subsurface is fundamentally controlled by gravity acting upon the topographic surface. Geomorphometric parameters that describe slope and contributing area are therefore direct proxies for hydrological processes. For instance, the Topographic Wetness Index (TWI), defined as $TWI \= \\ln(\\frac{a}{\\tan \\beta})$, where '$a$' is the specific upslope contributing area and '$\\beta$' is the local slope, quantifies the tendency of a location to accumulate water under steady-state conditions.2 This index and related concepts demonstrate that topography governs water movement, which in turn drives erosion, sediment transport, and deposition.3 Areas of topographic convergence (e.g., valleys, hollows) accumulate water and fine-grained material eroded from upslope, leading to deeper, more developed soils, whereas divergent areas (e.g., ridges, noses) tend to be erosional and have thinner soils.3

#### **Energy Flux**

Similarly, the flux of solar energy onto the land surface is strongly modulated by topography. The amount of incoming solar radiation (insolation) received at a specific pixel is a function of its slope, aspect (the direction it faces), and shading from adjacent topographic features.5 Topographic shading can be decomposed into two components: shaded relief (or self-shadowing), which occurs when the surface itself is angled away from the sun, and cast shadows, created by distant topographic features that block the sun.5 These effects create strong microclimatic gradients. In the Northern Hemisphere, south-facing slopes receive significantly more solar energy than north-facing slopes, leading to warmer and drier soil conditions, higher rates of evapotranspiration, and different vegetation communities.7 These topographically-induced energy gradients are a primary control on local water balance, snowmelt patterns, and the energy available for biological and chemical processes.6  
The influence of topography on these fluxes is inherently multiscale. The calculation of TWI at a single pixel, for example, requires information about the entire upstream contributing area, which can extend for kilometers.2 Likewise, cast shadows can be created by mountain peaks far from the pixel being analyzed.5 This multiscale dependency is a crucial concept that validates an approach using TDA-derived TLSPs. Because TLSPs are designed to capture topological features across a range of spatial scales, they are theoretically well-suited to serve as predictors for processes that integrate information from beyond the immediate pixel neighborhood. The strong alignment between the multiscale nature of the predictor variables (TLSPs) and the multiscale physics of mass and energy distribution provides a robust theoretical foundation for the regression model. TLSPs are not merely abstract shape descriptors; they are quantitative proxies for the integrated, multiscale fluxes across the landscape.

### **1.2 The Critical Zone Interface: Dynamics of the Soil and Regolith Mantle**

The soil and underlying regolith form the Earth's reactive, permeable "skin"—a critical zone where geology, hydrology, biology, and the atmosphere interact. The thickness of this mantle is a primary control on a vast range of Earth surface processes, including water storage, nutrient cycling, and landscape evolution.9  
The thickness of soil is not a static property but rather represents a dynamic equilibrium state achieved over geomorphic timescales. It is the result of the long-term balance between two competing, topographically-controlled processes: soil production from the weathering of underlying bedrock and soil transport via erosion and deposition on the surface.9

1. **Soil Production:** The rate at which bedrock is converted to soil is often modeled as a function that decreases exponentially with increasing soil thickness. Thin soils allow water and biological activity to reach the bedrock interface, promoting weathering, while thick soils insulate the bedrock, slowing or halting production.12  
2. **Soil Transport:** The movement of soil across the landscape is driven by processes like soil creep, which is often modeled as being dependent on topographic slope, and overland flow, which is dependent on both slope and contributing area.9

Since both production and transport rates are strongly controlled by topographic attributes—particularly hillslope curvature, which represents the divergence or convergence of transport pathways—the resulting thickness of the soil mantle is a direct, integrated expression of long-term geomorphic processes.12 For example, on convex, divergent hilltops (negative curvature), soil transport rates are high, leading to thin soils. In concave, convergent hollows (positive curvature), soil is deposited, leading to thick soils.4  
This relationship means that soil thickness can be viewed as a form of "geomorphic memory." The soil thickness at any given point on the landscape is an emergent property that integrates the entire history of landscape evolution at that location. It reflects the cumulative effect of topographically-driven processes over thousands to millions of years. Therefore, a regression model that predicts soil thickness from TLSPs is fundamentally testing the hypothesis that the present-day landscape shape contains sufficient information to infer the integrated outcome of the historical processes it governs. This represents a deep, mechanistic connection far beyond a simple spatial correlation.

### **1.3 The Topographic Template for Biogeochemical Cycles**

The topographically-controlled fluxes of water and energy, mediated by the properties of the soil and regolith mantle, create the physical template for all major biogeochemical cycles. The cycles of carbon and water, which are central to understanding and predicting climate change, are particularly sensitive to these topographic controls.17  
The spatial distribution of Soil Organic Carbon (SOC), the largest terrestrial carbon pool, is strongly correlated with topography.8 Topography influences SOC through several mechanisms:

* **Redistribution of Water and Matter:** Water flowing across the landscape transports dissolved and particulate organic matter, leading to the erosion of SOC from convex slopes and its accumulation in concave, depositional areas like valleys and footslopes.3  
* **Control on Plant Productivity (Carbon Input):** Topography influences soil moisture and solar radiation, which are primary controls on photosynthesis and plant growth. Sheltered, moist locations often support higher biomass production, leading to greater inputs of organic matter to the soil.8  
* **Control on Decomposition (Carbon Output):** Topography creates microclimates that affect soil temperature and moisture, which in turn regulate the activity of soil microbes responsible for decomposition. For example, SOC tends to increase with altitude, partly because lower temperatures at higher elevations reduce decomposition rates, allowing organic matter to accumulate.22

This web of interactions establishes a clear, hierarchical causal cascade that links the static geometry of the landscape to its dynamic biogeochemical state. This cascade can be conceptualized as follows:

1. **Multiscale Topography:** The fundamental landscape form, as measured by TLSPs.  
2. **Primary Fluxes:** Topography dictates the spatial patterns of water and energy fluxes.  
3. **Proximal Environmental Conditions:** These fluxes control the local, time-varying conditions of soil moisture and soil temperature.  
4. **Biogeochemical Process Rates:** The proximal conditions govern the rates of key biological and chemical processes, such as photosynthesis, respiration, and decomposition.  
5. **Integrated System State:** Over long timescales, the balance of these process rates leads to an emergent, slowly-varying system state variable, such as the total stock of soil organic carbon or the thickness of the soil mantle.

Predicting a variable from Step 5 (a system state) using predictors from Step 1 (topography) is a powerful, non-tautological approach. Tautology arises when predicting a variable that is too close to the predictor in the causal chain (e.g., using a DEM to predict slope). By selecting a target far down this causal chain, the regression model is challenged to learn the complex, integrated effects of the entire intervening cascade of physical and biogeochemical processes. This approach ensures that the model is mechanistically meaningful and directly addresses the core requirement for a non-tautological regression target.

## **Part II: Candidate Regression Targets ($H\_2$): A Systematic Evaluation**

Based on the theoretical framework established in Part I, several candidate metrics can be proposed as a suitable regression target ($H\_2$). Each candidate is evaluated here against the specified criteria: theoretical coherence with multiscale topography, scientific relevance (particularly for climate modeling), scale compatibility for a pixel-based CONUS-wide analysis, and its non-tautological nature.

### **2.1 Metrics of the Earth's Permeable Mantle**

These metrics describe the thickness of the unconsolidated layer that mediates most land-surface processes.

#### **Candidate 1: Soil Thickness (Depth to Bedrock)**

* **Theoretical Link:** Excellent. As detailed in Section 1.2, soil thickness is a direct physical manifestation of the long-term balance between soil production and soil transport, both of which are fundamentally governed by topographic parameters like curvature, slope, and contributing area.9 Landscape evolution models explicitly formulate soil thickness as a function of these topographic drivers, providing a direct, first-principles connection.9  
* **Scientific Relevance:** High. Soil thickness is a critical state variable in numerous Earth system models. It determines the total water storage capacity of a hillslope, which controls hydrological response, runoff generation, and plant-available water.9 It is also a key input for landscape evolution models and is essential for assessing slope stability and landslide hazards.11  
* **Scale Compatibility & Data Availability:** Poor. This is the primary limitation of using soil thickness as a regression target. While process-based and machine learning models can predict it at a pixel scale 9, there is no consistent, high-resolution (\<100 m) observational or modeled raster dataset of soil thickness covering the entire CONUS. The most widely available global product is a modeled dataset at a coarse \~1 km resolution, which may be insufficient for a high-resolution TDA study.35 High-resolution data are typically available only for small, localized study areas.36  
* **Non-Tautology:** Excellent. As an integrated, long-term product of geomorphic processes that evolve over millennia, soil thickness is fundamentally distinct from any instantaneous geometric property calculated from a DEM.

#### **Candidate 2: Regolith Thickness**

* **Definition:** Regolith is the complete layer of unconsolidated and weathered material, including soil, saprolite, and loose rock fragments, that overlies solid bedrock.37 Soil is merely the uppermost, biologically active portion of the regolith.  
* **Analysis:** Regolith thickness shares the same excellent theoretical linkage and high scientific relevance as soil thickness.25 However, it suffers from even more severe limitations regarding data availability and definitional ambiguity in terrestrial settings. The boundary between regolith and fractured bedrock is often gradational and difficult to define consistently.37 Consequently, comprehensive datasets for the CONUS are virtually non-existent. Available data are either highly localized 36, very coarse 35, or have been developed for extraterrestrial bodies like the Moon, where impact cratering creates a more clearly defined regolith layer.37 For a CONUS-wide terrestrial application, this metric is less feasible than soil thickness.

### **2.2 Metrics of Biogeochemical State**

These metrics represent the integrated state of key biogeochemical cycles, particularly those of carbon and water.

#### **Candidate 3: Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) Density/Stock**

* **Theoretical Link:** Excellent. As established in the causal cascade (Section 1.3), the spatial distribution of SOC is a direct consequence of topographically-mediated fluxes of water and energy.8 These fluxes control the balance between carbon inputs from plant productivity and carbon outputs from microbial decomposition, as well as the physical transport and deposition of organic matter.17 Numerous digital soil mapping studies have successfully used topographic variables as primary predictors for SOC, confirming this strong theoretical and empirical link.43  
* **Scientific Relevance:** Extremely High. SOC is a keystone variable in global carbon cycle science and climate change research. The soil C pool is larger than the atmospheric and terrestrial vegetation pools combined, and small changes in soil C stocks can have significant impacts on atmospheric $CO\_2$ concentrations.17 Accurately mapping and predicting the spatial distribution of SOC is therefore a critical scientific priority for inclusion in Earth system models.  
* **Scale Compatibility & Data Availability:** Excellent. This is the paramount strength of SOC as a regression target. In recent years, several high-resolution (30 m to 250 m), CONUS-wide or global raster datasets for SOC have been produced using advanced digital soil mapping and machine learning techniques.50 Prominent examples include the **POLARIS** 30 m dataset 54, the rasterized **gSSURGO** 10 m database 56, the **SOLUS100** 100 m dataset 58, and the global **SoilGrids** 250 m product.59 These datasets are perfectly suited in scale and format for a pixel-based, moving-window analysis across the CONUS.  
* **Non-Tautology:** Excellent. Similar to soil thickness, SOC is a slowly-varying, integrated state variable. It reflects the balance of biogeochemical processes over decades to centuries and is not an instantaneous property of the local geometry.

#### **Candidate 4: Spatially Averaged Soil Moisture**

* **Theoretical Link:** Excellent. Topography is a dominant, first-order control on the spatial patterns of soil moisture. The convergence and divergence of shallow subsurface flow, quantified by indices like TWI, creates persistent patterns of wetness and dryness that mirror the underlying topography.2  
* **Scientific Relevance:** High. Soil moisture is a key state variable in all land surface models. It governs the partitioning of incoming energy into latent heat (evapotranspiration) and sensible heat fluxes, thereby directly coupling the water and energy cycles and influencing local and regional weather patterns.64 It is also the primary determinant of water availability for plants.  
* **Scale Compatibility & Data Availability:** Good. A multitude of CONUS-wide gridded soil moisture datasets are available from satellite remote sensing (e.g., SMAP) and land surface modeling systems (e.g., NLDAS) at various spatial resolutions, typically ranging from 1 km to \~12.5 km.67  
* **Non-Tautology:** Good, but with a significant caveat related to temporal scale. Soil moisture is a highly dynamic variable, fluctuating on hourly to daily timescales in response to individual precipitation and radiation events.64 To serve as a regression target for relatively static topographic parameters, one would need to use a long-term average, such as the mean annual soil moisture. While this average does reflect the underlying topographic control, it is also heavily influenced by the specific weather and climate patterns of the averaging period. This introduces a significant amount of temporal "noise" that can obscure the more subtle, persistent signal of geomorphic control that TLSPs are designed to detect. In contrast, variables like SOC and soil thickness are "slow" variables that integrate processes over very long timescales (decades to millennia), effectively filtering out the high-frequency noise of weather events. This makes their spatial patterns a more "pure" expression of the long-term influence of topography, and thus a better theoretical match for predictors derived from a static DEM.

### **2.3 Metrics of Surface Energy Balance**

This category includes metrics that describe the primary energy input to the land surface.

#### **Candidate 5: Topographically-Modulated Potential Solar Insolation**

* **Theoretical Link:** Perfect. Potential solar insolation (i.e., clear-sky insolation) is a direct, deterministic function of latitude, time of year, and local topography—specifically slope, aspect, and topographic shading.5 It can be calculated with high precision directly from a DEM.  
* **Scientific Relevance:** High. Solar radiation is the ultimate energy source for most Earth surface processes. It drives surface temperature, evapotranspiration, snowmelt, and photosynthesis, making it a fundamental input for nearly all climate, hydrology, and ecosystem models.5  
* **Scale Compatibility & Data Availability:** Excellent. Potential insolation can be computed at the native resolution of any DEM using standard GIS software. Furthermore, CONUS-wide gridded datasets of actual and potential solar radiation are available from sources like the National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB) and Daymet at resolutions around 1-4 km.73  
* **Non-Tautology:** Fair. This is the principal weakness of this candidate. Although the calculation of insolation involves complex geometric relationships (including non-local effects like cast shadows), it is still a direct, deterministic calculation derived from the same DEM that is used to generate the TLSP predictor variables. A regression model of the form TLSPs \-\> Insolation would essentially be a test of whether the TDA-based features can effectively approximate a known, albeit complex, geometric function of the DEM. While this could be an interesting study in its own right, it does not meet the goal of predicting a separate, foundational *environmental state variable* that *results from* the integrated effects of topographic controls over time. It is an input driver to the Earth system, not an integrated state property like soil thickness or SOC.

## **Part III: Synthesis, Recommendation, and Implementation**

The systematic evaluation of the candidate metrics reveals a clear path forward. This section synthesizes the analysis, presents a definitive recommendation, and provides a practical roadmap for data acquisition and implementation for the proposed research project.

### **3.1 Comparative Analysis of Candidate Metrics**

The strengths and weaknesses of each candidate metric with respect to the project's specific requirements are summarized in Table 1\. This comparative framework highlights the trade-offs between theoretical purity, scientific relevance, and practical data availability. The analysis clearly shows that while several metrics have strong theoretical links to topography, only one excels across all criteria.

| Metric | Description | Theoretical Link to Topography | Climate/ESM Relevance | CONUS Data Availability (Pixel-Scale) | Non-Tautology | Key Advantage | Key Disadvantage |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Soil Thickness** | Vertical depth of soil from the surface to bedrock or parent material. | **Excellent**. Direct result of the long-term balance between topographically-controlled production and transport.9 | **High**. Critical for water storage, slope stability, and landscape evolution models.10 | **Poor**. No consistent, high-resolution (\<100 m) raster dataset exists for the entire CONUS.35 | **Excellent**. Integrated product of geomorphic processes over millennia. | Represents a pure, long-term geomorphic signal. | Lacks a suitable, readily available target dataset. |
| **Regolith Thickness** | Total depth of unconsolidated material (soil, saprolite) over bedrock. | **Excellent**. Similar to soil thickness, it is a product of long-term weathering and transport.25 | **High**. Important for deep groundwater recharge and geological modeling. | **Poor**. Even greater data scarcity and definitional ambiguity than soil thickness.36 | **Excellent**. Integrated product of geomorphic processes. | Fundamental property of the critical zone. | Data is extremely sparse and inconsistent. |
| **Soil Organic Carbon (SOC)** | Mass of organic carbon stored in the soil, expressed as density or stock to a fixed depth. | **Excellent**. Integrated result of topographically-mediated water/energy fluxes controlling C inputs and outputs.21 | **Extremely High**. Largest terrestrial C pool; a keystone variable in global carbon cycle and climate models.18 | **Excellent**. Multiple high-resolution (10-250 m) datasets available for CONUS (e.g., POLARIS, gSSURGO, SoilGrids).54 | **Excellent**. Integrated biogeochemical state variable reflecting processes over decades to centuries. | Optimal balance of theoretical depth, climate relevance, and data availability. | Minor inconsistencies may exist between different data products. |
| **Mean Soil Moisture** | Long-term average of volumetric water content in the soil. | **Excellent**. Topography is a first-order control on water redistribution and moisture patterns.2 | **High**. Key state variable controlling land-atmosphere energy and water fluxes.64 | **Good**. Numerous datasets available, but typically at coarser resolutions (≥1 km).68 | **Good**. Represents an integrated state, but is a "fast" variable subject to high-frequency weather noise. | Directly links topography to the water cycle. | High temporal variability introduces noise, obscuring the geomorphic signal. |
| **Potential Solar Insolation** | Clear-sky solar radiation received at the surface, modulated by topography. | **Perfect**. A direct, deterministic geometric calculation from the DEM.5 | **High**. The primary energy input driving most surface processes.7 | **Excellent**. Can be calculated from any DEM or obtained from datasets like Daymet.77 | **Fair**. It is a direct calculation from the same source data as the predictors, creating a degree of circularity. | Easily and accurately calculable at any scale. | Tautological; it is an input driver, not an integrated system state variable. |

### **3.2 Top Recommendation: Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) Density**

Based on the comprehensive analysis, **Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) Density (kg C/m³) or SOC Stock (kg C/m² to a fixed depth)** is the top recommendation for the regression target ($H\_2$).  
This recommendation is based on a synthesis of its exceptional performance across all of the project's requirements:

1. **Optimal Balance of All Criteria:** SOC is the only candidate that scores "Excellent" or "High" on every key criterion: theoretical linkage, climate relevance, data availability, and non-tautology. It avoids the data scarcity issues of soil thickness while possessing the same theoretical depth and non-tautological rigor.  
2. **Theoretically Profound Target:** Predicting SOC with TLSPs is a powerful test of the causal cascade hypothesis outlined in Section 1.3. It frames the research as an attempt to model how fundamental landscape structure gives rise to a critical biogeochemical state. This elevates the potential scientific contribution of the project beyond a simple pattern-matching exercise into the realm of predictive, process-based understanding.  
3. **Immediate Practical Feasibility:** The existence of multiple, high-quality, high-resolution, peer-reviewed, and publicly available CONUS-wide SOC raster datasets makes the project immediately actionable. There is no need for prohibitive preliminary work to generate a suitable target variable; the focus can remain on the novel application of TDA.  
4. **Keystone Climate Change Variable:** By selecting SOC as the target, the project is positioned at the heart of contemporary climate change science. The ability to better predict the spatial distribution of soil carbon using novel geomorphometric techniques would be a significant contribution to a field grappling with the uncertainties of the global carbon cycle, ensuring the research has high relevance and impact.18

### **3.3 A Practical Guide to Implementation and Data Sourcing**

To move forward with this recommendation, several practical steps are necessary.

#### **Units and Definitions**

It is crucial to distinguish between different SOC metrics.

* **SOC Concentration:** Typically measured in percent (%) or grams of carbon per kilogram of soil (g/kg). This metric does not account for how compacted the soil is.  
* **SOC Density:** Measured in kilograms of carbon per cubic meter of soil (kg/m³). This is calculated as $SOC\_{concentration} \\times Bulk Density$.  
* **SOC Stock:** The total mass of carbon over a given area to a specific depth, measured in kilograms per square meter (kg/m²) or tonnes per hectare (t/ha). This is calculated by integrating SOC density over a depth interval (e.g., 0-30 cm).

For a regression target, **SOC density** or **SOC stock to a fixed depth** is strongly recommended over concentration. These metrics account for variations in soil bulk density, which is also influenced by topography and land use, providing a more accurate measure of the total carbon present in the soil volume. Most modern datasets provide the necessary variables (SOC concentration, bulk density) to calculate these metrics.

#### **Data Source Review and Recommendation**

Several excellent datasets are available for the CONUS. The choice among them depends on the specific resolution requirements and methodological preferences of the project. Table 2 provides an overview of the leading candidates.

| Dataset | Spatial Resolution | Vertical Resolution | Methodology | Coverage | Key Reference/Source | Potential Considerations |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **POLARIS** | 30 m | Standard depths (0, 5, 15, 30, 60, 100, 150 cm) | Machine learning (DSMART-HPC) remapping of SSURGO, incorporating high-res environmental covariates. | CONUS | 54 | Probabilistic output provides uncertainty estimates. High resolution is ideal for TDA. |
| **gSSURGO** | 10 m (rasterized) | By soil horizon for each map unit component. | Traditional field-based soil survey mapping (polygons), rasterized for ease of use. | CONUS | 56 | Highest nominal resolution, but spatial detail is limited by the original polygon boundaries. |
| **SOLUS100** | 100 m | Standard depths (0, 5, 15, 30, 60, 100, 150 cm) | Machine learning framework combining multiple soil survey sources and environmental covariates. | CONUS | 58 | Provides a consistent, continuous map product. Resolution may be slightly coarse for some applications. |
| **SoilGrids** | 250 m | Standard depths (0, 5, 15, 30, 60, 100, 200 cm) | Global machine learning model (Quantile Random Forest) using WoSIS soil profiles and covariates. | Global | 59 | Globally consistent methodology. Resolution is the coarsest among the options. |

#### **Final Data Recommendation**

While all the datasets listed in Table 2 are viable, the **POLARIS 30-meter probabilistic soil properties dataset is the primary recommendation**.54 Its 30 m resolution is an excellent match for analyses based on the standard USGS National Elevation Dataset (NED). Its modern machine-learning methodology is less constrained by the artificial boundaries of legacy soil map polygons than gSSURGO, resulting in a more spatially realistic product. Finally, its probabilistic nature is a unique advantage; the dataset provides not just a mean prediction but a full probability distribution for each pixel, which could potentially be used to weight the regression analysis by data certainty. The SOC values for the topsoil layer (e.g., 0-30 cm, which can be calculated by depth-weighting the 0-5, 5-15, and 15-30 cm layers) would serve as an ideal, robust, and scientifically critical regression target for this project.
