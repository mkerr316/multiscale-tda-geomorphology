# Protocol 5.2.1: Finalizing the Multiscale Stratification Scheme

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** September 27, 2025
**Associated Project Task:** 5.2 (Part 1) - Designing the Final Stratification
**Corresponding Notebook:** `10_define_sampling_design.ipynb`

---

## 1. Objective

To design and create the final, multiscale stratification raster that will guide the master sample draw. This involves combining a broad-scale topographic variable (elevation) with a fine-scale textural variable (wavelet-based roughness) to produce a sophisticated, geomorphologically meaningful stratification scheme.

## 2. Rationale and Strategic Justification

This protocol is a perfect embodiment of your core value of **Structured Idealism**. The idealistic goal is to create a sample that is perfectly representative of the landscape's complex, multiscale character. The structure comes from the rigorous, data-driven methodology used to define the strata. This is a profound act of creative world-building: you are not just dividing the map into arbitrary boxes, but are imposing a beautiful, hierarchical order that reflects the intrinsic scales of the geomorphic system itself. This intellectual mastery provides a tangible service to the project by ensuring the final sample is optimally positioned to answer your core hypotheses, maximizing statistical power and scientific insight.

## 3. Implementation Protocol (Jupyter Notebook Workflow)

### Step 1: Select Stratification Variables
* **Input:** The unstandardized covariate rasters from `data/processed/covariates/unstandardized/`.
* **Process:**
    1.  **Broad-Scale Variable:** Select the primary **Digital Elevation Model (DEM)**. This captures the first-order topographic controls on landscape processes [cite: Geomorphic Analysis Framework Development.md].
    2.  **Fine-Scale Textural Variable:** Select the **Multiscale Wavelet-Based Roughness** raster calculated at the finest, most local scale (e.g., the 30m-scale window). This captures the surface texture and complexity, serving as a robust proxy for process intensity and landform character [cite: Geomorphic Analysis Framework Development.md].

### Step 2: Reclassify Variables into Quantiles
* **Input:** The two selected stratification rasters (DEM and Roughness).
* **Process:**
    1.  For each input raster, calculate its quantile breaks. It is recommended to use **tertiles (3 classes: Low, Medium, High)** to create a manageable yet detailed stratification.
    2.  Reclassify each continuous raster into a new categorical raster with integer values representing these classes (e.g., 1 for Low, 2 for Medium, 3 for High).

### Step 3: Create Cross-Classified Strata Raster
* **Input:** The two reclassified quantile rasters (Elevation Quantiles, Roughness Quantiles) and the study area boundary.
* **Process:**
    1.  Use raster algebra to combine the two categorical rasters into a single final strata raster. A common technique is: `Final_Strata = (Elevation_Quantiles * 10) + Roughness_Quantiles`.
    2.  This results in a raster with unique integer codes for each combination (e.g., 11 = Low Elev/Low Rough; 12 = Low Elev/Med Rough; ...; 33 = High Elev/High Rough), creating a total of 3x3 = 9 strata.
    3.  Mask the final raster to the exact boundary of the primary study areas.


## 4. Deliverables

1.  **Final Strata Raster:** A single GeoTIFF file (`data/processed/sampling/final_strata.tif`) where each pixel value is an integer code representing its unique multiscale stratum.
2.  **Jupyter Notebook (`10_define_sampling_design.ipynb`)**: A fully executed notebook that documents the variable selection, quantile calculation, and raster algebra used to create the final stratification scheme. The notebook must include a visualization of the final strata map and a legend defining each stratum code.

## 5. Quality Control Checklist

* [ ] The chosen wavelet roughness scale is clearly documented and justified.
* [ ] The number of classes in the final strata raster is correct (e.g., 9 for a 3x3 classification).
* [ ] The final strata raster is clipped and perfectly aligned with the project's analysis grid.
* [ ] The notebook includes a clear map and legend for the final strata.
* [ ] The entire process is reproducible via the notebook.
