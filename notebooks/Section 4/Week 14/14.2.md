# Protocol 14.2: Preparing the Final Research Presentation

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** September 27, 2025
**Associated Project Task:** 14.2 - Prepare a presentation for both technical and general audiences.
**Corresponding Deliverable:** `Kerr_Michael_Final_Presentation_Fall_2025.pptx`

---

## 1. Objective

To create a single, modular, and visually compelling slide deck that synthesizes the project's entire narrative arc. The presentation will be designed with two distinct audiences in mind: a **technical audience** (e.g., a departmental seminar for geographers and computer scientists) and a **general academic audience** (e.g., the CURO Symposium). The goal is to have a core set of slides that can be adapted with audience-specific "deep dive" slides.

## 2. Rationale and Strategic Justification

Michael, this is the ultimate act of **teaching and synthesis**, a direct expression of your core talents. It is the final and most crucial step in making your work truly impactful. A brilliant project that is poorly communicated remains a hidden gem. A brilliant project presented with clarity, elegance, and passion becomes a landmark.

This is the capstone of your **intellectual mastery**, demonstrating that you not only understand your complex work but can make it accessible and exciting to others. The **harmony and beauty** of this protocol lie in the narrative arc—the art of crafting a story that guides an audience from a clear problem to a powerful solution and an inspiring conclusion.

The **tangible service** of this deliverable is immense. This presentation is a high-value, reusable asset that will serve as the foundation for your CURO presentation, your defense, conference talks, and even the "elevator pitch" you'll use in graduate school interviews. Mastering the art of the scientific story is a critical skill for a high-impact career.

## 3. The Core Narrative Arc (The Story for All Audiences)

Your presentation should follow this clear, five-act structure:

1.  **The Problem:** The language we use to describe landscapes is broken. Traditional metrics are unreliable and scale-dependent (the "curvature crisis").
2.  **The Big Idea:** What if we could move beyond measuring local *form* and instead quantify the intrinsic, multiscale *shape* of a landscape?
3.  **Our Solution:** We developed a new language using Topological Data Analysis (TDA) to create novel "Topological Land-Surface Parameters" (TLSPs). We built a beautiful, robust pipeline to do it.
4.  **The Test:** We tested this new language on a hard, real-world problem: predicting physical erosion from a state-of-the-art model (WEPP).
5.  **The Verdict & The Vision:** The new language works. It significantly improves our ability to predict erosion. This opens up a new frontier for quantitative geoscience.

## 4. Slide-by-Slide Presentation Blueprint

Use the final figures from `29_final_synthesis_and_visualization.ipynb` as the visual anchors.

* **Slide 1: Title Slide**
    * Title: A Multiscale Topological Framework for Linking Landscape Shape to Physical Process
    * Your Name, Department(s), University of Georgia

* **Slide 2: The Language of Landscapes is Broken**
    * **Visual:** Side-by-side images of curvature calculated in two different GIS platforms, showing contradictory results.
    * **Narrative:** "The tools we use to describe landscapes are flawed. Metrics like curvature can give opposite answers depending on the software you use. This is the 'implementation crisis', and it limits our ability to do robust, reproducible science."

* **Slide 3: A New Idea: From Measuring Form to Quantifying Shape**
    * **Visual:** A simple, intuitive diagram comparing a ruler (measuring local form) to a CT scanner (revealing internal structure/shape).
    * **Narrative:** "We need to move beyond simple measurements. We need a new language that can capture the fundamental *shape* and *connectivity* of a landscape. For this, we turn to a new branch of mathematics: Topological Data Analysis."

* **Slide 4: Our Solution: The Topological Land-Surface Parameter (TLSP)**
    * **Visual:** A simple animation or diagram showing the "sliding window" concept, where a small window of the DEM is converted into a persistence diagram, which is then summarized to a single pixel value.
    * **Narrative:** "We developed a new kind of map—a TLSP. It's a map not of elevation, but of topological complexity. Each pixel tells us about the 'shape' of the landscape around it, like how connected the ridges are, or how deep and significant the basins are."

* **Slide 5: The Grand Challenge: Can Shape Predict a Physical Process?**
    * **Visual:** Your **Figure 1a** (Study Area Map).
    * **Narrative:** "To test our new language, we applied it to a difficult, real-world problem. We used a state-of-the-art physical model called WEPP to simulate sediment yield across two geomorphic provinces in the Southern Appalachians. Our central question: Can our abstract 'shape' maps predict these physical erosion patterns?"

* **Slide 6: Result 1: Landscapes Have Unique Topological Signatures**
    * **Visual:** Your **Figure 2a** (the beautiful UMAP plot showing clear separation).
    * **Narrative:** "First, we found that our TLSPs can easily tell the difference between landscapes. When we view our data through a topological lens, the Blue Ridge and Piedmont provinces form two distinct, clearly separated continents. This confirms our first hypothesis."

* **Slide 7: Result 2: The 'Shape' of Erosion**
    * **Visual:** Your **Figure 3a** (the boxplot comparing model RMSEs).
    * **Narrative:** "This is the key result. A model using only traditional metrics performs well. But a model armed with our new topological language performs *significantly* better, reducing predictive error by [X]%. Shape is a powerful predictor of process."

* **Slide 8: The "Why": Building a Geomorphic Vocabulary**
    * **Visual:** Your **Figure 3b** (the SHAP summary bar chart).
    * **Narrative:** "Why does it work? Our interpretation revealed that our topological feature for basins was the second most important predictor in the model. We found a strong correlation: the bigger the basin, the higher its topological signature. Our model learned a fundamental geomorphic truth: landscapes with big, complex basins are better at trapping sediment."

* **Slide 9: The Final Picture: A New Map of Erosion Risk**
    * **Visual:** Your **Figure 4** (the stunning final map of predicted erosion draped on a hillshade).
    * **Narrative:** "This is what it all comes together to create. A new kind of erosion map, powered by topology, that shows us how the very shape and structure of the landscape control where erosion happens. You can see the model correctly predicts low erosion in the sediment-trapping basins we identified."

* **Slide 10: Conclusion: A New Language for a New Generation of Geomorphometry**
    * **Visual:** A simple summary slide with your 2-3 main takeaways.
    * **Narrative:** "We successfully developed a new framework that links abstract shape to physical process. We've shown that Topological Land-Surface Parameters are powerful, interpretable, and predictive. This opens a new frontier for quantitative geoscience, allowing us to ask and answer questions about the Earth's surface in a fundamentally new way."

* **Slide 11: Acknowledgements & Questions**
    * Thank your mentors, funding sources (CURO), etc. Open for questions.

### **Audience Adaptation (Technical vs. General)**

* **For the General Audience (CURO):** Use the 11-slide structure exactly as above. It is a clean, powerful, and accessible story.
* **For the Technical Audience (Departmental Seminar):** Use the same 11 slides as your core narrative, but insert the following "deep dive" slides at key moments:
    * **After Slide 4:** Add a slide on your **Computational Framework**, showing a diagram of the Dynamic Dask setup and the `map_overlap` halo region logic.
    * **After Slide 5:** Add a slide on your **Sampling Design**, showing **Figure 1b** (the multiscale strata) and briefly explaining the rationale for the Local Cube method.
    * **After Slide 8:** Add a slide on **Topological Interpretation**, showing your **Mapper Graph** colored by province, explaining how it provides a "topological skeleton" of the feature space.

## 5. Deliverables

1.  **Final Presentation File (`Kerr_Michael_Final_Presentation_Fall_2025.pptx`)**: A single, polished PowerPoint or Google Slides file containing the core 11-slide narrative, plus the optional "deep dive" slides for a technical audience. The speaker notes for each slide should be populated with key talking points and reminders.
2.  **A one-page Handout (`Handout.pdf`)**: A simple, elegant PDF with the Abstract, the final synthesis map (**Figure 4**), and your contact information. This is a high-value, professional touch for networking after your talk.
