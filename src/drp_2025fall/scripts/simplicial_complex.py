        ### --- Discussion of Findings ---

        This simulation generated {NUM_COMPLEXES_TO_RUN} random simplicial complexes on a set of {NUM_VERTICES} 
        vertices. The parameters for construction were a {PROBABILITIES.get(1, 0):.0%} probability of adding an edge 
        (`p₁`) and a {PROBABILITIES.get(2, 0):.0%} probability of filling in a triangle where its boundary existed 
        (`p₂`). The analysis of the resulting topologies yielded an average Euler characteristic (χ) of **{avg_chi:.2f}**.

        The distribution of the Euler characteristic is visualized in the histogram and box plot.
        The histogram shows a unimodal, roughly symmetric distribution centered on the mean,
        with the vast majority of generated complexes having a χ between -14 and -6. The
        box plot further clarifies this, indicating that 50% of the outcomes (the
        interquartile range) fall between approximately -11 and -7. The proximity of the
        median (≈ -9) to the mean ({avg_chi:.2f}) confirms the distribution's general symmetry
        and identifies one complex with χ ≈ -18 as a rare outlier.

        The consistently negative Euler characteristic provides a clear picture of the generated topology:
        the value of χ is determined by the formula:
        `χ = (#Vertices) - (#Edges) + (#Triangles)`.
        With our parameters, the typical complex consists of approximately:
        - `k₀ = {NUM_VERTICES}` (vertices)
        - `k₁ ≈ 22` (edges, on average)
        - `k₂ ≈ 3` (triangles, on average)

        The resulting `χ ≈ 10 - 22 + 3 = -9` is driven by the fact that a large number of edges are formed, but 
        relatively few of these connections are filled in to create 2-simplexes. This generates a sparse, web-like 
        structure rich in 1-dimensional loops and cycles. The negative χ quantitatively confirms that the number
        of edges consistently overwhelms the number of vertices and triangles combined.

        The simulation successfully demonstrates how local probabilistic rules of construction give rise to a 
        predictable global topology. The parameters chosen reliably produce complexes that are not simple collections 
        of points, nor are they solid, filled-in objects. Instead, they are predominantly graph-like structures whose 
        many loops are quantified by a strongly negative Euler characteristic.
